window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emma, older sister of renowned rock star Jake McKallister, has crafted a quiet existence for herself. Fiercely independent, scorned at work, and indifferent to relationships, she's spent the past decade trying to move on from the crime that shook her family to the core. Living by a promise she made to herself as a distraught 16-year-old, Emma has sworn off marriage and children...until a chance encounter with a scruffy hitchhiker throws her orderly world into chaos. </p> <p>A wild child raised in mayhem by a teenage mother, fearless Finn Perry cruises through life as the perennial nice guy. Now a struggling actor, he supports himself by performing daredevil stunts. At a crossroads in his life, one thing has always remained constant in his world: Finn's desire to start the family he never had. The mystery woman who rescues him from the side of the road sure seems like the perfect person for the job. </p> <p>But unfinished business from Emma's troubled past looms heavy, threatening to destroy the fledging love she's found with the only man to ever jump-start her wounded heart. </p>";
