window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He’s my brother’s best friend.&nbsp;</p> <p>The hot single dad next door.</p> <p>And one accidental sext later, my massive crush on him is no longer a secret.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s my own damn fault. I’m 30 years old, for heaven’s sake. I’m a kindergarten teacher and a (reasonably) responsible adult. I should know better than to get tipsy and draft a fake text listing all the dirty things I wish Officer Cole Mitchell would do to me.&nbsp;</p> <p>I wasn’t supposed to hit send.</p> <p>He wasn’t supposed to see it.</p> <p>And he definitely wasn’t supposed to text back telling me to go on....</p> <p>Because after that, things escalate quickly.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cole is everything I’ve ever wanted. He’s sexy and protective. A devoted father to his little girl. A dedicated cop the whole town adores. The kind of guy you can trust to keep his hands to himself, even when you’re desperately hoping he won’t.</p> <p>I’m not the girl he thought he’d end up with, but after all this time, I might finally get the chance to say the words I’ve always dreamed of...make me yours.</p>";
