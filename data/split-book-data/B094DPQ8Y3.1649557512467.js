window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He was gorgeous, older, and had the worst reputation in all of England. The way he looked at me sent shivers down my spine. </b></p> <p>Our first meeting was at a wedding, where he followed me outside and kissed me. Our second meeting ended in a huge fight with me kicking him out. Our third meeting, I went on a double blind date. You can imagine my surprise when I saw familiar blue eyes across the table opposite my friend. Oh...no....</p> <p>He was sarcastic and witty, and damn, if he wasn’t the sexiest bastard I ever laid eyes on. Then, he sent me an email listing 30 reasons why I should go on a date with him. I was expecting a suave and intelligent list. Curious, I read on. Reason one - I have white teeth. Reason two - I love my grandma. Reason three - I have a size 13 shoe - you do the math. The man’s a fool, his list was some of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever read. And the funniest. We laughed hard...and loved harder.</p> <p>You can outrun everything...except your past. And his has caught up. Wild, handsome players don’t fall for innocent girls like me. Or do they?</p>";
