Gus' new life on a communal farm is peaceful. The daily routine of policing the fields is rarely disrupted by straying undead. His drinking binges are over.

What he finds is a new predator unleashed upon the land, one determined to harvest every last mortal life.... And feed it to a ravenous machine.</p>";
