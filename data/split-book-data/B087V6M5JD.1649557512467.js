window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A brand new book in the Sinful Men series! Indulge in this friends-to-lovers romance narrated by Scott Brick and Samantha Cook!</b></p> <p>Just because you want a woman doesn't mean you get to have her. I've been lusting after Mindy Gamble since the night I met her, but romance was never in the cards. Working to crack a case was the only order of the day. Now, a year later, she's one of my closest friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>The feisty, no-nonsense, sexy-as-hell blonde that I just want to slap my handcuffs on and do bad things to. I resist though, since I need her too much as a friend. Until the night all my resistance cracks, and we fall into bed together. And I start thinking we can maybe find a way to make this work. Until she tells me she's leaving town...</p>";
