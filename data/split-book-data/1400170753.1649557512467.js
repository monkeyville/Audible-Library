window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is 1989 and the disease resulting from the testing of experimental bioweapons has ravaged much of the world. The UK and Europe are in chaos as the virus spreads uncontrollably. The US, nominally arriving in force to offer military and humanitarian assistance to their allies, are posturing dangerously with the east and failing to unite over the common enemy of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As command and control are ramping up operations over the British Isles and Europe, the remnants of Johnson's Yeomanry and the scattered troops consolidate their position on their island stronghold and begin to look to the future, but events beyond their knowledge and control force them into desperate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Peter, alone by choice and oddly thriving, finds himself suddenly responsible for the life of someone other than himself. Adapting with ease, the young boy begins to show the difference between nature and nurture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Elsewhere, other survivors stake their own claims to land and resources, but the inexplicable swarms of undead threaten to gather and dissipate constantly.</p>";
