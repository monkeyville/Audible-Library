window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Chantal Fernando comes the latest in the Wind Dragons Motorcycle Club series featuring a red-hot romance and plenty of mystery! </p> <p>Ranger is at a crossroads: He has a chance to leave the motorcycle club and do something else with his life - but he keeps getting dragged back. When the Wind Dragons Motorcycle Club asks for his help, Ranger agrees, not only because it is hard to say no to them but also because he has a vested interest. </p> <p>A woman is missing. </p> <p>And Ranger knows her. </p> <p>The Wind Dragons aren't the only ones hoping this girl can be found - on the hunt is Johanna Chase, a stubborn detective who won't give up until the missing woman is found safe. She needs Ranger to navigate the underground world of motorcycle clubs, and immediately sparks fly. Ranger fights the attraction. He has no plans on going there, no matter how beautiful and badass she is. A biker and a cop? Ridiculous. </p> <p>But the two of them soon realize that they're in way over their heads, and now they have to trust each other in order to save her. With the WDMC and the police force at their back, it should be no problem, right? </p>";
