window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Galactic Alliance's hard-won success in countering the Yuuzhan Vong onslaught has proven all too brief, and the tide has turned once more to the invaders' advantage.</p> <p>Having overcome the sabotage strategies of the Jedi and their allies, the marauding aliens have pushed deeper into the galaxy and subjugated more worlds in their ruthless quest for domination. Coruscant has been remade into a Yuuzhan Vong stronghold. The remnants of the resistance are struggling to form a united front. Luke, Mara, and Jacen are missing in action. Clearly, the stage is set for an endgame.</p> <p>Now, as Han and Leia receive the chilling news that hundreds of high-ranking Galactic Alliance prisoners face slaughter in a sacrifice to the enemy's bloodthirsty gods, Luke and his team try desperately to convince the living world of Zonama Sekot to join the Jedi's final campaign against the Yuuzhan Vong. Yet even as they speak, a lone space station is all that stands between Alliance headquarters on Mon Calamari and wave after wave of ferocious enemy forces waging their most decisive assault.</p> <p>At the same time, the Jedi's alliances throughout the galaxy are being tested, and the chances of victory jeopardized, by rogue factions determined to deploy the lethal weapon that will exterminate the Yuuzhan Vong and perhaps countless other species. And among the Yuuzhan Vong themselves, the threat of revolt has reached a boiling point, as the oppressed underclass and powerful officials alike fear their Supreme Overlord's mad actions will provoke the wrath of the gods.</p> <p>Ultimately, for both the forces of invasion and resistance, too much has been sacrificed, and too much is at stake, to ever turn back. And now, nothing can stand in the way of seizing victory or facing annihilation.</p>";
