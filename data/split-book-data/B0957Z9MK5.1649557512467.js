Yet I suppose it's a fair question, considering I'm an uninvited stranger standing in Boone Mason's kitchen.</p> <p>If you think that's bad - just wait. It gets worse.</p> <p>This charming and wealthy playboy, who can't pay his bills on time or find his way to the grocery store (but we all have flaws, right?), is sweet. Confident. Playful. He's almost perfect. And, to make matters worse...</p> <p>He's smitten with me.</p> <p>I know what you're thinking. You're rolling your eyes. You're assuming this is some opposites attract situation - or that maybe we can be friends who turn into something more.</p> <p>How can this be a bad thing?</p> <p>Well, it's simple. I'm not the kind of girl you fall in love with. Just to be sure, the universe reminds me of that in an unforgettable, in-your-face kind of way.</p> <p>I might have broken into Boone's house, but I won't let him break my heart. I won't break his either. There's too much on the line to be that reckless.</p> <p><i>Reckless </i>is a stand-alone romance filled with lots of heart and heat.</p>";
