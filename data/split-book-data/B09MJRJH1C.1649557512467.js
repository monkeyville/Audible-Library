window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Queen of Anarchy</i> is the heart-pounding second installment in the Dirty Broken Savages series.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> The blurb below contains spoilers for the first book, so I'd highly recommend not reading it until you've finished listening to book one, <i>Kings of Chaos</i>. You've been warned!</p> <p>\"I was a good girl once. But bad b*tches get shit done.</p> <p>My list is finished. Every name has been crossed off. I should be sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere, breathing easy for the first time in years.</p> <p>But I’m not.</p> <p>Because that asshole Ivan St. James refused to stay at the bottom of the river where Knox put him.</p> <p>Because someone dragged his body up from the depths and laid it out as a very public, very gruesome warning.</p> <p>Because I swear it was Hannah’s eyes I saw behind that mask.</p> <p>Nothing makes sense anymore, and if I thought I might find some peace in knowing that the men who hurt us are dead, I was wrong.</p> <p>The game isn’t over yet. The original deal I struck with the Kings of Chaos is null and void, and despite my plan to walk away from them when this was all done, there’s no way I can do that now.</p> <p>Our fates are entwined, at least until we sort out this mess.</p> <p>Honestly, I don’t know how to feel about that. Because as much as I refuse to let my walls down for anyone, I’m starting to think these four brutal, dangerous men...</p> <p>Might be the only ones I can trust.</p> <p><i>Queen of Anarchy </i>is a full length mafia/gang new adult romance featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men. This audiobook contains dark themes, so please listen at your own discretion. It is book two of four.&nbsp;</p>";
