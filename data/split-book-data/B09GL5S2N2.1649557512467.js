window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>I never claimed to be a good girl, but I definitely never asked for this.</i></b></p> <p>Killian, Tristian, and Rath.</p> <p>These three men are a part of my past - one that I'd rather never look in the eye again. In high school, they knew my secrets and I knew theirs. They had power and I had nothing. The night everything fell apart, my stepbrother allowed his two best friends to take their rage out on me while he watched. While&nbsp;they&nbsp;laughed.</p> <p>But what happened that night wasn’t my biggest secret. So I ran, planning on never coming back.</p> <p>Three years later I’m standing on their doorstep like a stray. They’re more powerful than ever now, having risen to the rank of Lords at Forsyth University. But I’m still on the run and there's another monster chasing me down.</p> <p>What could bring me back into their lives, their homes, and ultimately, their beds?<br> <br> Fear.<br> <br> Shame.<br> <br> Desperation.<br> <br> Killian, Rath, and Tristian aren’t the only ones who want me. There’s someone far more dangerous out there who's been stalking me since I left town the first time. Someone who makes the evil I know feel less dangerous than the evil I don’t.<br> <br> But being their Lady is more than just fancy clothes and reputation.<br> <br> I might be under their protection, but I’m also at their mercy.<br> <br> <i>And there's nothing a Lord loves more than taking control.</i></p> <p><i>Warning: This book is a Dark/Bully&nbsp;romance.
