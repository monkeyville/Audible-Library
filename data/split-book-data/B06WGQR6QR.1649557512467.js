window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Defy</i> is a smutty, insta-love, insta-lust short novella. <i>Defy</i> is a prequel to <i>Vicious</i>. It is recommended, but unnecessary, to listen to <i>Defy</i> before you listen to <i>Vicious</i>. My name is Melody Greene, and I have a confession to make. I slept with my student, a senior in high school. Multiple times. I had multiple orgasms. In multiple positions. I slept with my student and I enjoyed it. I slept with my student and I'd do it all over again if I could turn back time. My name is Melody Greene, and I got kicked out of my position as a teacher and did my walk of shame a la Cersei Lannister from the principal's office, minutes after said principal threatened to call the cops on me. My name is Melody Greene, and I did something bad because it made me feel good. Here is why it was totally worth it. </p>";
