Once again, events unfolding far beyond their knowledge conspire to bring a new type of terror to the survivors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Others, displaced from what had been their place of safety, struggle to survive against age-old enemies: cold and hunger. In a bold move, they break out, only to make unexpected discoveries which could spell a chance for them to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In a bid to undo all progress, the untested serum is deployed on a massive scale which tips the scales steeply against humanity's chances to win. To live. To remain the dominant species on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Fleeing the seemingly unstoppable enemy, they pin their hopes on a final attempt for freedom, but that means they must turn their backs on their home forever.</p>";
