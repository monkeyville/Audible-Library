window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Returning to Madison hurts. I thought I'd left my past behind, but the past goes on living. I carry it inside of me, it's a piece of me. People have marked me in indelible ways, and I drag the shreds of my soul behind me, trying to put my pieces back together. I'm not the Amber I used to be. I fly under the radar, try to be invisible. </p> <p>It doesn't always work. Drawing attention scares me. It always spells trouble. Returning to my hometown is a last-ditch effort to lay my demons to rest and start anew, for good this time. </p> <p>Meeting Jesse Lee wasn't in the plan. Yet here he is with his heart-stopping, sexy grin, handsome like a god, shining bright. He's full of life, full of heat, packing the energy of a thousand suns in his gaze and muscular body. Jesse burns, and the pain of being near him is sweet. </p> <p>But he's foiling my plans. It's hard to remain a ghost when he's around. Hard to avoid his attention, to remain invisible. He sees me, really sees me, and behind his bright radiance, I can see shadows from his own past crowding in. He's swimming hard to stay afloat even as he reaches for me. </p> <p>What is he afraid of? And how can he save me from drowning when he can't even save himself? </p> <p>Stand-alone novel. No cliff-hanger. </p> <p>Warning: This book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature listeners only. Not intended for young listeners. </p>";
