Only the two of us.</p> <p>We swore to put each other first, to take on the evils our families had perpetuated together. Side by side.</p> <p>But that was before the past returned to haunt us.</p> <p>Now, everything has changed.</p> <p>Stefan can't have both his past and my future. I can't ask him to choose. And neither of us can do what has to be done without the other. It's an impossible choice, but we've run out of time.</p> <p>This is the third book in the Arranged Trilogy.</p>";
