window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cannon: The first female Cerberus team member wasn't impressed with my corny pickup lines and wide smile like the other women I use it on. I should move on, but her rejection stings. I also can't figure out if it's the chase I crave, or if this woman is someone special I've been missing in my life.</p> <p>Rocker: Life can change in the blink of an eye. But I never imagined the biggest life-altering situation of my life would show up at our door bruised and bloodied, confessing her role in a man's death. It's a lot to wrap my head around. Unfortunately, it's not even half of the story....</p> <p>Colton: Detective Colton Matthews has experienced a lot in the last ten years. How hard would it be to allow, Sophia, Dominic Anderson's daughter, to shadow him for a few months to complete a college credit and keep things professional? The short answer.... Impossible. Especially when his job puts her in danger.</p> <p>Drew: Falling for a girl I just met was never in my plans. Then I found her again. She was broken...unseeing eyes no longer filled with life. My life was ruined, and all I had to fall back on was the Cerberus MC.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
