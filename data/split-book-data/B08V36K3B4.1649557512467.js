My enemies turned friends turned lovers.</p> <p>These boys have never been saints, but this war that's brewing is resurrecting their inner demons. Once upon a time, I was their target. This time, I'm calling the shots.</p> <p>Senior year is my year. This year, I'm going to bring down my enemies. This year, I'm going to run my tongue along the blade of vengeance and taste blood. The Havoc Boys are mine, and we were here first.</p> <p>You don't mess with a Havoc Girl without paying the price. You don't start a rebellion without a little bloodshed. My boys and I don't mind using two wrongs to make a right - I just hope our brewing obsession with one another doesn't kill us all first.</p>";
