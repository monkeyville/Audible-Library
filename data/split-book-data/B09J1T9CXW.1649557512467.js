window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They dragged the boy I loved from my arms and accused him of a murder I know he didn't commit. Now all I want is revenge.</p> <p>But with secrets from my past dredged up at every turn, I have no idea who to trust.</p> <p>We’ve lived through the lies. It’s time for the truth to be revealed. No matter the cost.</p> <p>They say the truth will set you free. But in Saint View, it might just kill you first.</p> <p>The explosive conclusion to the Saint View High trilogy. <i>Twisted Little Truths</i>&nbsp;is the story of three bad boys and a girl who knows how to stand her ground. It is a mature high school/new adult why-choose romance, meaning the main character has more than one love interest. This audiobook contains enemies-to-lovers and bullying themes, and there may be triggers for some listeners. It is the third and final book in an ongoing trilogy and cannot be listened to as a stand-alone.</p>";
