window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>People</i> magazine named Eloisa James' novel <i>Midnight Pleasures</i> \"Page Turner of the Week\" and raved, \"Romance writing does not get much better than this.\" Now the acclaimed author returns with another sumptuous tale of passion and misadventure in Regency England. </p> <p>Gabrielle Jerningham cherishes the portrait of her betrothed, the perfect Peter Dewland... until she meets his commanding older brother Quill. But it is Peter to whom she has been promised. And how can she possibly transform her voluptuous, outspoken self into the poised gentlewoman Peter requires? </p> <p>When Gabby's shocking d√©colletage plunges to her waist at her first ball, Peter is humiliated. But Quill comes to the rescue, to the peril of his heart. An accident years before has left Quill plagued by headaches - the kind that grow more excruciating with strenuous exercise. Needless to say, this hardly bodes well for siring progeny. But the very sight of Gabby leaves Quill breathless. One forbidden kiss and Quill vows to have her, headaches and Peter be damned! But it will take a clever man - and a cleverer woman - to turn the tables on propriety and find their way to true love. </p>";
