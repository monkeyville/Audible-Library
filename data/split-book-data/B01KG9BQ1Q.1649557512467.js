But one night of partying lands him in a heap of trouble and sent back to the confinements of his hometown. Things can't possibly get worse, right? Sarah Morris can't seem to run fast enough away from her past. She's spent months trying to amend her ways, and is doing a pretty good job.

Enter Graham Nichols, the one mistake Sarah can't escape. </p>";
