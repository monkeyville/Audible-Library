window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Best Seller </b></p> <p>Han Solo and Lando Calrissian are reunited on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> in a galaxy-spanning novel inspired by <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>. But even the fastest ship in the galaxy can’t outrun the past...</p> <p>THEN:&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s one of the galaxy’s most dangerous secrets: a mysterious transmitter with unknown power and a reward for its discovery that most could only dream of claiming. But those who fly the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> throughout its infamous history aren’t your average scoundrels. Not once, but twice, the crew of the <i>Falcon </i>tries to claim the elusive prize - first, Lando Calrissian and the droid L3-37 at the dawn of an ambitious career, and later, a young and hungry Han Solo with the help of his copilot, Chewbacca. But the device’s creator, the volatile criminal Fyzen Gor, isn’t interested in sharing. And Gor knows how to hold a grudge....</p> <p>NOW:&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s been 10 years since the rebel hero Han Solo last encountered Fyzen Gor. After mounting a successful rebellion against the Empire and starting a family with an Alderaanian princess, Han hasn’t given much thought to the mad inventor. But when Lando turns up at Han’s doorstep in the middle of the night, it’s Fyzen’s assassins that he’s running from. And without Han’s help, Lando - and all life on Cloud City - will be annihilated.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the assistance of a young hotshot pilot, an Ewok slicer prodigy, the woman who might be the love of Lando’s life, and Han’s best and furriest friend, the two most notorious scoundrels in the New Republic are working together once more. They’ll have to journey across the stars - and into the past - before Gor uses the device’s power to reshape the galaxy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Praise for <i>Last Shot</i>:</p> <p>“Action-packed in all the right ways.” (Tordotcom)</p> <p>“A fun, breezy read, with plenty of humor, Ewok hackers, murderous robots, and rousing fight scenes as Han and Lando go from scrape to scrape [to] track down a long-forgotten enemy.” (The Verge)</p> <p>“The flat-out funniest Star Wars novel to date.” (Alternative Nation)</p>";
