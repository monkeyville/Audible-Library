window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Evangeline's life is dark and lonely. She'll do anything to change that. Anything. Even play a game with a stranger she's never met. What starts out as \"therapy\" soon turns into a passionate anonymous love affair. Her blindfold is like a security blanket and his touch is what lights a fire inside her.</p> <p>I have no idea who he is, what he looks like, or why he agreed to play this game with me. But I don't care. I don't even care that I have to wear a blindfold before he'll come into my room. I don't care that he watches me sleep, and dress, and wants to know all my deepest, darkest, saddest secrets.</p> <p>She's lost. Sad and lost. And even though it's my job to watch her from the other side of the surveillance cameras, that's not why I enter her room at night. That's not why I touch her when she begs. That's not why I'm really here.</p> <p>I want her, but does she really want me? Or does she just like the idea of loving a stranger?</p> <p><i>Includes a special bonus note read by the author.</i></p>";
