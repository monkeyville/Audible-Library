And now, she needs my help - and a place to stay. Senior year was supposed to be the year to keep some distance until the season finished and my draft prospects were safe.</p> <p>But resisting her is becoming impossible.

And one heated night, I can’t stop fighting every cell in my body and can’t stop myself from sampling her sexy smile, sweet smell, and sultry curves.</p> <p>We’re walking a tightrope with my future on the line.
