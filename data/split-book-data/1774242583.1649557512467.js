What he finds may change the war forever.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Celestials are drawing closer to locating Earth with every passing day.

They have amassed a wealth of weapons, shields, and the strongest military ever conceived. But it may not be enough.</p> <p>The Celestials have gone on the offensive, attacking Alliance colonies and key points of interest throughout the galaxy, destroying valuable resources that humanity needs to fight back.
