With everyone in her life attempting to control her, she takes matters into her own hands and leaves town without so much as a plan or a destination. </p> <p>But the destination finds her as car trouble forces Paige to settle down in a small Southern town as she waits for repairs. There she meets the handsome, albeit standoffish, Tatum Montgomery, and both of their lives are forever altered as they learn that sometimes when you aren't looking for love, it finds you anyway. The real question is: Can you hold on to it when you're from two completely different worlds? </p>";
