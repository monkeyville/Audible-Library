window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author J.L. Berg, comes a breathtaking story that shows us how love truly can conquer all... even the most damaged of hearts. </p><p>Within these walls, he became my solace, my sanctuary, and my strength. I am not strong. I am just a survivor of circumstance. Isn't that what we all do? Survive? Each of us has our own set of circumstances to muddle through. Mine are just more.... complicated. </p><p>Born with a severe heart defect, I've seen the inside of a hospital room more than my own bedroom. I was drowning, a prisoner to the illness that owned me, until he appeared. He thinks he's blocked out the world with his tattoos and hard exterior, but I see the real Jude, the one he so desperately wants to forget. But is he the answer to my prayers or will he break my already damaged heart forever? </p><p>My name is Lailah Buchanan, and this is our story of hope, redemption, and sacrificing it all for the one you love.</p>";
