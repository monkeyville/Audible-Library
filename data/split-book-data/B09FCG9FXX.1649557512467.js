window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Hell hath no fury....</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>I thought I was trading one evil for a lesser one. Marry a man I might eventually love, forge an alliance between his gang and my father's, and get out from under Dad's sadistic thumb.&nbsp;</p> <p>Turns out my fianc√© has other plans. Like slaughtering me and my entire family the night before the wedding.&nbsp;</p> <p>I make it out alive, left with nothing but a thirst for vengeance. But if I want to crush the prick who betrayed me, I have to turn to the biggest pricks of them all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hot, cocky, and dangerous, Wylder Noble and his men rule Paradise Bend. Their help doesn't come cheap. I've got to prove I'm strong enough to deserve it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Whatever they throw at me, I can take it. No taunting words or scorching looks will break the wall around my heart.&nbsp;</p> <p>They think I'm made of glass? I'm a girl of shards that can cut you to the bone.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before this is over, someone's going to bleed. And this time, it won't be me.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Scorned Princess</i> is the first in a new gritty contemporary romance series from best-selling author Eva Chase (writing as Eva Chance) and Harlow King. No major triggers, but be prepared for domineering men who make their own rules, a rebellious heroine who's not afraid to get her hands dirty, and an enemies-to-lovers romance where the girl gets <i>all</i> the guys. It's going to be a wild, bloody ride!</p>";
