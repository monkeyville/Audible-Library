window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Coy Mason is a jerk.&nbsp;</p> <p>If there is one truth that Bellamy Davenport knows, it’s that. Well, that, and the fact she didn’t mean to hurt him. Physically. Coy can’t be hurt emotionally because he doesn’t have a heart.&nbsp;</p> <p>Coy is not just the small-town, literal boy next door. He’s a heartbreaking, womanizing, mischief-making (and delicious) man and was all of those things well before he became a hot-shot country music sensation.&nbsp;</p> <p>He’s a dream standing in her doorway with no shirt, messy hair, and a “Do you wanna\"? grin. But he’s also a nightmare for her heart, and she knows it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their enemies-to-lovers relationship always ends the same way - heavy on the enemies, light on the lovers.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, why is she still standing there?&nbsp;</p> <p>Author's Note: <i>Reputation </i>is a stand-alone novel with heat and heart. No cliff-hanger.&nbsp;</p>";
