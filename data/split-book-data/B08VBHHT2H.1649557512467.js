window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Riley Appleton loves to hate me.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s my fault the hate is there in the first place. She needed somewhere to direct her anger, and I volunteered to be the target. Being adored is boring. I wanted something different.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each jab that falls from her pretty mouth is a challenge, and the more we fight, the hotter we burn. But soon, this game of ours goes too far. She needs to be reminded who really rules this relationship.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our feud is a joke - but in the end, I’ll be the only one laughing.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>This is a dark high-school-bully romance with mature content and themes. It contains dubious situations that some listeners may find offensive. If you're looking for a white knight hero, this book is not for you. </b></p> <p><b>Listening order: </b>First three are a trilogy and should be enjoyed together; the rest are stand-alones.&nbsp;</p> <p>1. <i>Wicked Dreams</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>2. <i>Wicked Games </i></p> <p>3. <i>Wicked Promises</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>4. <i>Vicious Desire (Eli) </i></p> <p>5. <i>Cruel Abandon (Liam)</i></p> <p>6. <i>Wild Fury (Theo) </i></p>";
