Check. Inherit a hundred-billion-dollar company? Check. Produce an heir.... Wait, what? </p> <p>I have 90 days to knock up my brand-new fake wife. There's only one problem - she hates my guts.

But I've never backed down from a challenge, and I'm not about to start now. Mark my words - I'll have her begging for me, and it won't take 90 days. </p>";
