window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I believe in love. It just doesn’t believe in me. I date. I’m all for giving guys a chance. I’ve just never met the one. Until on a spring morning in the English countryside, a tall, dark stranger emerges from the mist.</p> <p>Logan Steele is all tousled hair, hard chest, and lips so perfect I want to reach out and touch them, just to check they’re real. I’m sure that’s a thunderclap of chemistry I feel between us. Did I mention he’s an Earl with a self-made fortune? A billionaire who works tirelessly for charity? And he’s so hot, watching him is like staring at the sun. But like I said, love isn’t rooting for me.</p> <p>When I find out Logan Steele is out to destroy everything I’ve dedicated my life to protect, the chemistry disappears and the hope that had blossomed my chest turns to rage. It no longer matters that he quickens my pulse just saying my name, weakens my knees with a single touch, and that he might just be the greatest kisser that ever lived. I might believe in love, but Logan Steele is definitely not the one.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>A stand-alone romance.</i></p> <p>For Harper and Max's story, listen to<i> King of Wall Street. </i></p> <p>For Scarlett and Ryder's story, listen to <i>The Duke of Manhattan. </i></p> <p>For Violet and Alexander's story, listen to<i> The British Knight. </i></p> <p>For Grace and Sam's story, listen to<i> Park Avenue Prince.</i></p>";
