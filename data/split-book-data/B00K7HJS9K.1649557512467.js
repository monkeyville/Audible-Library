window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Billionaire Max Hamilton thought he was finally starting to find contentment, more than two years after losing his wife Mia in a tragic drowning accident. He'd been reunited with a sister he hadn't realized existed. Finally he had family again, a reprieve from the pain and loneliness that had haunted him since his devastating loss. Yeah...he was as happy as a man could be, considering he had lost the other half of his soul and most of his heart when fate had torn his wife away from him. Or so he believed...until the day he rescued a mysterious woman in the park, a female who somehow had managed to reignite a part of him that he thought was long dead. Suddenly, Max's protective, dominant, possessive male instincts flared to life, leaving him at a loss as to how lightning could possibly strike twice in one lifetime. Is he truly being given another chance at real happiness, or would it be dangled in front of him, only to be taken away once again? </p>";
