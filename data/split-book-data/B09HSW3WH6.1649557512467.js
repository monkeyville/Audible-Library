window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>West Golden - fierce protector. The one.</p> <p>The cocky jock I once wanted to kill with my bare hands is now the only one I trust with my heart.</p> <p>In a city full of corruption and dark secrets, knowing who’s on your side gets harder to determine every day. Especially now that Vin’s on the warpath, passing out threats he fully intends to see through to the end. His power here in Cypress Pointe seems limitless, and I don’t have time to see if that’s true. I’m prepared to make sacrifices to keep my family safe.</p> <p>Even if what’s sacrificed is my own happiness.</p> <p>As our circle of loyal friends becomes clear, we cling to it, because it’s all any of us has. And if there’s one thing Vin didn’t count on, it’s that blood isn’t always thicker than water.</p> <p>He might just find out firsthand why it’s never wise to cross the king’s queen.</p> <p><i>Forever Golden</i> is the highly anticipated conclusion to this portion of the saga, and a lead-in to the Kings of Cypress spinoff. This book is the final installment of a trilogy and should only be listened to after completing books one and two, <i>The Golden Boys</i> and <i>Never His Girl</i>.</p> <p>This series contains strong bully themes. So, if you’re not into romances where hate turns into love (...eventually), and if you don’t like your heroes of the unapologetically alpha variety, this might not be the series for you. There is no rape or dubious consent whatsoever. However, due to adult themes and sexual situations, this one’s only for the 18+ crowd.</p> <p>This series is sure to give you <i>GOssip Girl</i> and <i>One Tree Hill</i> vibes, and the angst will have you resisting to pause to find out what happens next. Get lost in this series today!</p> <p>Smooches,</p> <p>RJ &amp; NT</p>";
