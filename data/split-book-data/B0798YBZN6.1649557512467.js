window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author, Corinne Michaels, comes a new heartwarming standalone romance.</b></p> <p>I'm getting really good at cutting my losses.</p> <p>First, the husband. Divorcing him was the best decision I ever made. But between single-parenting and job-hunting, I can't catch my breath. When a celebrity blogging position falls into my lap, I'm determined to succeed.</p> <p>That is, until I get my first assignment and actually see Noah Frazier for the first time...practically naked and dripping wet. My heart races and I forget how to form complete sentences. His chiseled abs, irresistible smirk, and crystal blue eyes are too perfect to be real. So, what do I do? Get drunk and humiliate myself, of course.</p> <p>I'm ready to forget the awkward night, yet Noah has no intention of allowing me to move on. Instead, he arranges for me to write a feature on him, ensuring a lot more time together. One embarrassing moment after another, one kiss after another, and before I can stop myself, I realize - I'm falling in love with him.</p> <p>But when the unthinkable happens, can I even blame him for cutting his losses?</p> <p>What I wouldn't give for just one last time....</p>";
