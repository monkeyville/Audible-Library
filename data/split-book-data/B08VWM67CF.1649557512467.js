window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From<i>&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling author Corinne Michaels comes a new second-chance&nbsp;stand-alone&nbsp;love story.</p> <p>At 18, I walked away from Willow Creek Valley for good. I was young, scared, and stupid, and it cost me the love of my life - Grayson Parkerson.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fourteen years later, a crash sends me back home to recover.&nbsp;</p> <p>Back to where we met, fell in love, and planned a future. The one he’s now living as a single dad to his daughter. Working at The Park Inn together gives us a chance to reconnect, and seeing him with his little girl makes me long for the days when he was mine. One look in his gorgeous blue-green eyes, and it’s like I never left. One kiss, and my world is upside down. One night together, and I know without a doubt, in his arms is where I belong.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m not the girl I was - intimidated by his wealthy family and desperate to escape our small town. I can imagine a new life for us here.&nbsp;</p> <p>But he’s learned to guard his heart, and trust won’t come easily. How can I convince him to give first love a second chance?&nbsp;</p>";
