window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Brentwood Boys have come together in a three-book audio collection for the first time ever! More than 30 hours of delicious baseball players brought to you by your favorite narrators including Sebastian York, Savannah Peachwood, Stephen Dexter, Rock Engle, Felicity Monroe, and Maxine Mitchell.</b></p> <p><b><i>The Locker Room</i></b></p> <p>Have you heard the rumor around campus about the locker room?</p> <p>Legend has it if you bring a girl into the sacred after-game domain of the baseball locker room, it will end with a walk down the aisle.</p> <p>So when the girl I've fallen for brushes me off, I start to question if I need to switch my way of thinking. Maybe it's time I finally hand out a coveted invitation to the locker room.</p> <p>The only question is, will she accept?</p> <p><b><i>The Dugout</i></b></p> <p>Let me ask you a question: If someone is vying for your spot on a team and just so happens to injure you during practice, would you believe it was on purpose?&nbsp;</p> <p>Word around campus is...it was no accident.</p> <p>That injury has cost me everything. Now, I’m a senior fresh off recovery, struggling to find my groove, until the day I run into The Baseball Whisperer, Milly Potter.</p> <p>Little do we both know, she’s about to become more than just my fairy ballmother.</p> <p><b><i>The Lineup</i></b></p> <p>Want to know a secret?</p> <p>That boy over there, the one with the spectacular backside, yeah, I first saw him in college, talking to his friends. Tall, broad, sculpted by his many hours in the weight room. His personality was larger than life and I was too shy to approach him.</p> <p>Now he’s a professional baseball player, I’m a confident CEO, but my crush is still strong. Yup, massive crush.</p> <p>I have a chance at winning a date with him.</p> <p>Should I enter?</p>";
