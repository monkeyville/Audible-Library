And the knowledge and skills they possess.</b></p> <p>On the island of Big Tancook, Collie Jones is making plans. She informs the islanders that it’s time to resume her original mission - to find other survivors, screen them, and return them to the island. Every survivor she brings back is one more valuable addition to the skill and gene pool.</p> <p>But first, she must return to the place whence she came.</p> <p>She must secure the elaborate government bunker called Whitecap and its vast stores of munitions within.</p> <p>With a small group accompanying her - including Gus Berry, the Mountain Man - the islanders will once again return to the mainland and confront a new enemy.</p> <p>An enemy who has the very same goal of locating survivors, but for a different purpose.</p> <p>To build an empire.</p> <p><i>Contains coarse language and violence.</i></p>";
