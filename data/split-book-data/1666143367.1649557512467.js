window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Griffin: I was the golden child. The one all the Cerberus guys looked up to. Unfortunately, my not so honorable discharge from the Corps didn't get rid of the demons created while I was enlisted. I'll destroy her just like I destroyed everything else I touched.</p> <p>Samson: The love I felt for my babysitter, Camryn Davison at such a young age transformed over time. By the time I saw her again at 21, I was determined to make those fantasies a reality. If only she'd see me as the man I am now and not the little boy she used to soothe when I had nightmares as a child.</p> <p>Tug: I walked away from my best friend, my lover, the only man I could see spending my life with to make a career of being a Marine, but it didn't happen. Now, 13 years later, I've met a woman and a man who makes everything seem ideal. It's just my luck that one's a ghost and the other is my boss' daughter.</p> <p>Scooter: I work with the Cerberus MC for the thrills, not for the glory. Saving people who've been trafficked is just a side benefit. Mia Vazquez didn't seem to get the memo. When I pulled her out of hell, she wouldn't let go. She's mine, and letting go of me doesn't mean I'll let go of her.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
