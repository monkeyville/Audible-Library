Once upon a time, they ruled me. For an entire year, I endured their shit. But senior year is going to be different.</p> <p>This year, I own them. I’ve made a pact with the Havoc Boys to get the vengeance I deserve. Their price? Me. At their beck and call, in their beds, a part of their gang.</p> <p>Their girl. A Havoc Girl. Those dirty, rotten boys are going to get revenge against everyone that’s wronged me — everyone but themselves.</p> <p><i>Havoc at Prescott High</i> is a 118,000 word mature high school/new adult romance with enemies-to-lovers/love-hate themes. It has brief flashbacks of past bullying incidents as well as foul language and sexual scenes; any sex featured is consensual. This is a reverse harem novel, meaning the main character has more than one love interest. This is book one of three in the series.</p>";
