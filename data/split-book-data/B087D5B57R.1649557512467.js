window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My d*ck never got me in half as much trouble as my heart....</b></p> <p>We were high school sweethearts. I was head over heels for her and no one could tell me we weren't going to last forever. College? Going pro? My family's money? None of it mattered. She was all I needed.</p> <p>Then she ripped my heart out. But I'm not going to let that happen again.&nbsp;</p> <p>She's back. Invading my life and acting like she was the wronged one. The pain is still there, but I can't keep my eyes off her. I can't stop thinking about her and how much was left unsaid between us. Being this close is making me question everything I thought I knew about her.&nbsp;</p> <p>This time everything will be on my terms. Everything....</p>";
