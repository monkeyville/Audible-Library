I ran from my painful past too raw and fresh to escape. He was the only one who looked at me like I wasn’t broken and made me believe it. He made me feel it.</p> <p>Now, he’s the hot, angry hockey player on the mend.</p> <p>I’m the physiotherapist who’s supposed to get him back on his feet.</p> <p>I don’t think our night together was what his doctor prescribed, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t dreamt of him every time I close my eyes. I woke up beside him with my body still singing from the way he fanned the flames of my desire, but I couldn’t stay.</p> <p>His lips on my neck. His hands wrapped around my waist. His impressive...ahem, touch leaving me breathless.</p> <p>One moment of wild inhibition, and it’s come back to bite me in the butt. Kind of like he did that night.</p> <p>But a baby? Our night was supposed to be a one-time thing, closing a door on the future I couldn’t handle.&nbsp;Will this new bump in the road be everything we needed to find our forever?</p> <p><b><i>Heartless King</i></b><b> is a stand-alone friends-to-enemies-to-lovers, accidental pregnancy romance that brings all the laugh-out-loud, angsty feels!</b></p>";
