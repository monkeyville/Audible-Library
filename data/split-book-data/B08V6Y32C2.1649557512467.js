And now Maggie Todd knows my secret. She’s waiting for the right moment to use it against me. But every time I face off against her, I learn things I shouldn’t want to know. Like how deeply her competitive streak runs, and how sexy that is. And how easy it is to make her blush...everywhere.</p> <p>An Adler and a Todd cannot be lovers. Breaking that rule is like pulling a pin on a grenade - everything in my life could blow up. Can we surrender to these feelings...or will our families’ feud make us its next casualty?</p>";
