window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joel and Jethro. Roommates. Total hunks. Inseparable friends. Hot as hell. </p> <p>Meet my fantasy boyfriends. Aren't they just the sexiest, cutest thing? I know, right? They totally are. They are hot, too hot for a quiet - and obsessed with them - girl working in a bookshop. That'd be me, by the way. </p> <p>There's also the tiny problem of Joel wanting another girl. And as for Jethro, well...he doesn't do girls. Or maybe he doesn't do relationships. He certainly doesn't do boys, so he isn't doing his best and very male friend...right? Much less his male friend and me at the same time. </p> <p>So it's fine to crush on them. And write a serial story on my blog in which we are together. All three of us. Whew. </p> <p>I mean, it's okay. It's perfectly safe. They'll never even know I exist, much less find out about my blog and my secret fantasy about them. Right? </p> <p>Yeah, that's what I thought, too. </p> <p>Warning: This book contains two super-hot boys and a nerdy, funny girl who has the hots for them. </p> <p>Warning 2: This book may set you on fire. Handle with caution. </p> <p>Warning 3: This book is funny, and dark, and angsty. It is not a love triangle. It is a relationship between three people with a happy ending. <i>Candy Boys</i> is a stand-alone, full-length romance with an HEA. </p>";
