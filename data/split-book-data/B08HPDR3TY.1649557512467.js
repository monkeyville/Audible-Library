window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cruel. Heartless. Quarantined. The ruthless boys of Everlake Prep never saw lockdown coming. But the virus isn’t their number one enemy. I am.</p> <p>And as if being confined to a boarding school for the elite wasn’t bad enough, now I’m stuck in isolation with the boys who hate me most too.</p> <p>Saint, Kyan, and Blake.&nbsp;The Night Keepers. Or so they call themselves. They’ve embodied the Native American legend which lives in this valley, taking on the role of the&nbsp;monsters&nbsp;who lurk in the forest. And though they act like&nbsp;beasts, they may also be&nbsp;the most tempting creatures I’ve ever seen.</p> <p>With the&nbsp;virus&nbsp;escalating and my dad’s name splashed through the news, my entire world is falling apart. What he did has cast a&nbsp;dark shadow&nbsp;over me. And the Night Keepers want to&nbsp;make me pay&nbsp;for his crimes.</p> <p>Then things went from bad to worse when I touched the sacred rock. A rock which supposedly holds a&nbsp;curse&nbsp;to bind me as the Night Keepers’&nbsp;slave. And as crazy as it sounds, I decided to play along. Because there are things about me they don’t know. Things my dad has hidden from me for years. All I can be sure of is that I have to find a way to&nbsp;escape this school.&nbsp;But until then, those&nbsp;savage boys&nbsp;are making my life a living hell.</p> <p>As the&nbsp;virus&nbsp;sweeps through the country and the world twists into something ugly and unknown,&nbsp;the kings of this school become true monarchs.&nbsp;Even the teachers bow to them now. And I’m kinda glad about that ‘stay six feet away from one another’ rule, because without it, I know they’d rip me apart.</p> <p>At least there’s a silver lining. I’m cosying up to Coach Monroe. My hot as hell, brooding P.E.&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;who has a vendetta of his own against the Night Keepers. And with his help, I may succeed at doing more than escaping the clutches of these heartless fiends. I might even destroy them along the way.</p> <p>My father taught me how to be strong. How to prepare for the end of the world. So this isn’t going to be the end of&nbsp;my&nbsp;world, mark my words. But if I’m able to use my mind and body to bring these assholes to their knees,&nbsp;it might just be the end of theirs.</p> <p>This is a high school bully reverse harem&nbsp;series which means the main character will end up with multiple love interests. It may have triggers for some as it has off the charts angst, dark love-hate themes, scenes of intense bullying, sexual scenes, and some violence (not aimed towards the main character)&nbsp;and is not for the faint of heart. Prepare to enrol at Everlake Prep. Bring your hand sanitiser, face masks and toilet paper to barter with, but don’t expect to hold onto them for long.\"</p>";
