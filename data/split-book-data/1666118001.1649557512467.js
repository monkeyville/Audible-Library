They want to pretend like I didn't kill my rapist and they didn't help. But we're not ordinary college students, that much has become clear to me, and I'm growing tired of all of the lies and secrets.</p> <p>Their masks are cracking, and, finally, I'm starting to see the grotesque reality underneath. It's far darker than I ever expected, and it's not enough. They know everything about me, so now it's my turn. I fear nothing. Not them. Not the man that I killed or the people who set me up.</p> <p>Fear is for the weak, and I, Avalon Manning, am anything but.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
