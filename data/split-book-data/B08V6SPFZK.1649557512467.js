window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jonah Daniels has enough to do during hockey season without spending time interviewing a roommate to help share expenses. So when some dude answers J.D.’s ad and agrees to his terms, he puts a key under the mat and leaves for practice.&nbsp;</p> <p>What he doesn’t expect is that his new roommate is not a dude at all but an overtalkative, energetic hottie. What’s worse? She’s the younger sister of his friend on the team, and she’s sworn him to secrecy.</p> <p>Ryann Reiner needs a place to live, stat. After an incident at the dorms that almost tanked her scholarship, Ryann wants a boring roommate who’ll leave her alone. J.D. almost fits the bill. He lives and breathes hockey, just like her brother, and he wouldn’t know a joke unless it checked him against the boards.</p> <p>He’s also gorgeous. And broody. And he looks fine on laundry day, in too little clothing. Soon, late night study sessions turn into dangerous flirting. And then a kiss turns into more. But they’re determined to keep things in the feelings-free zone.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until lines blur and tensions rise when Ryann’s brother learns the truth. And both their hearts are skating on thin ice....</p>";
