window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Corinne Michaels comes a new sexy stand-alone romance novel.</p> <p>I have two rules in life:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>No relationships, falling in love, or attachments.</li> <li>No sleeping with clients of my interior design firm.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>Since the last guy turned out to be married, they’ve been easy-to-follow.</p> <p>Until him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Callum Huxley is a ridiculously sexy Brit, and the connection we have the moment our eyes lock scares the ever-loving hell out of me. Thank God I came to my senses before going back to his hotel where I would’ve ended up naked, panting, and unable to forget him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thinking I walked away from that night unscathed was stupid. Sure enough, at the biggest meeting of my career waits the CEO of Dovetail Enterprises - him. It might be the most embarrassing moment of my professional life. And breaking my no-client rule might just be the hottest moment of my personal life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Learning to trust has never felt so good, but falling has never hurt so bad.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are four stand-alone novels in The Second Time Around Series.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>We Own Tonight (Heather &amp; Eli)</i></li> <li><i>One Last Time (Kristin &amp; Noah)</i></li> <li><i>Not Until You (Nicole &amp; Callum)</i></li> <li><i>If I Only Knew (Danielle &amp; Milo)</i></li> </ol>";
