I have no idea if it’s the lie I know or one that I don’t.</p> <p>Since arriving back into Shadow Grove, I’ve been stalked, tormented, chased, and almost killed. I’ve been lied to, repeatedly, by people I was growing to trust.</p> <p><i>Liar.</i></p> <p>That word haunts me. Someone knows more about my life than I do. Someone is taunting me with answers and teasing me with secrets. Am I desperate enough to fall for more deception?</p> <p>Archer and his boys made a huge mistake when they lied to me. They thought they could play me, but they’re about to learn that they’ve met their match.</p> <p>No one stabs Madison Kate and gets away with it.</p> <p><i>Liar </i>is a full-length college/new-adult romance with enemies-to-lovers/love-hate themes.
