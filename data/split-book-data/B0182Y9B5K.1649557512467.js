window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When hockey phenom Billie-Jo Barker returns home and decides to play in the local Friday night hockey league, all hell breaks loose. Not because Billie's talent is in question but because Billie is a woman. And though these are modern times, some of the local guys still have a problem letting a girl into their \"men's club\". </p> <p>Soon Billie is at the center of a small -own battle of the sexes, with everyone choosing sides. Her sisters. The townsfolk. Her friends. And yet the only person whose opinion she cares about doesn't seem to care much at all. Logan Forest, the man who broke her heart when she was 18 and the man she now shares the bench with every Friday night. </p> <p>She's got a lot to prove. Though Billie-Jo Barker scores on the ice, will this girl ever score with the man of her dreams? </p>";
