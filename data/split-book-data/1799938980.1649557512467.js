window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dear diary,</p> <p>Once upon a time...there was a girl with long, golden hair who had the truest, bluest eyes that turned white when she cried.</p> <p>She lived in a kingdom far, far away in a tower made of stone, but her mind was made of glass that she kept sharp as knives.</p> <p>Where her memories hid behind her darkest doubts. Her deepest thoughts. Her diary became the only thing she could rely on.</p> <p>No one saw through her looking glass. No one cared. No one tried.</p> <p>Until the villain presented himself as the hero in her life. He took and took and took some more.</p> <p>With no regret. With no shame. With no apology.</p> <p>The page never turned. Their story didn’t end. Tomorrow never came. His life of debauchery was their journey to nowhere.</p> <p>She’d give anything to go back in time. To walk where she had walked. To see what she had seen. One step. One breath. One day at a time. Though in the end, “I love you” were just words.</p> <p>That destroyed us inside.</p>";
