window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A blind date. A nervous sorority girl. A mean-spirited fraternity prank. What could go wrong? </p> <p>As a sorority pledge, there are commandments that Katie Vickery must live by. One: Thou shalt not show up for the party without a date. Two: The guy shall be an athlete, preferably an upperclassman. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Katie just broke up with her jerkface football player boyfriend. Even worse, her last encounter with him resulted in utter humiliation. She'd rather hide under the bed than attend a party where he'll be. </p> <p>Yet staying home would mean letting him win. </p> <p>Enjoying herself was out of the question. She could only hope to get through the evening without her blind date noticing that he was spending the evening with a crazy person. </p> <p>Andrew Baschnagel is living proof that nice guys don't finish first. He's had his eye on Katie since the moment her long legs waltzed into his art history class. So when her roommate sets Andy up to be Katie's date, he'd be crazy to say no. </p>";
