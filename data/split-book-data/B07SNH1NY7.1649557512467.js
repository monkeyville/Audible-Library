There used to be five, but one of them died, leaving a fifth position that I now fill.&nbsp;</p> <p>I didn't ask for this. I didn't want to be part of this billionaire-boys-club. But no one cares about what I want.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sebastian Beckett is the worst of them. Their leader. He draws me in, and strips me of every defense I have. He calls me Butterfly, but it's not a pet name, it's a threat. Beck wants nothing more than to break my wings, pin me to a board and watch me writhe.&nbsp;</p> <p>He wants to see me broken.
