Not a single one.&nbsp;</p> <p>I let the media twist and distort the story. My new recruits eagerly proved themselves in spreading false news, in covering our tracks. To the general public, the Tri-State Timberwolves were extinct.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that couldn’t have been further from the truth. We changed, we grew, we evolved and came out stronger than ever. Now, I live, eat, sleep, and breathe Timberwolves. I’ll do anything to keep my empire safe and thriving. To keep the people depending on me safe.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, what do I do when it’s my own weakness that places us all in danger? When I let sex cloud my judgment and my people pay the price?&nbsp;</p> <p>Simple. Kill the distractions.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m called Hades for a reason, after all.</p>";
