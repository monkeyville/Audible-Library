window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A stand-alone, enemies-to-lovers office romance set within the Rydeville Elite world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Demi&nbsp;</p> <p>Dropping out of college senior year was never part of my plan. But Dad needs me, and I'd move mountains for the only parent I’ve ever known - even working for the company that fired him.&nbsp;</p> <p>My boss, Charlie, is determined to make my life a living hell, availing of every opportunity to undermine my confidence, humiliate, and threaten me.&nbsp;Sleeping with him the night of his wedding might have something to do with his attitude.&nbsp;</p> <p>Or, the fact I’m the spitting image of the woman he really wants.&nbsp;</p> <p>If our financial situation wasn’t so dire, I’d tell Charlie to stick his job up his delectable butt. But I’m trapped, and things are only getting worse. Because the more layers I uncover, the more I realize he is nothing l expected and everything I crave. <br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Charlie&nbsp;</p> <p>If there was a manual for all the ways a person could mess up his life, it’d have my name written on it.&nbsp;</p> <p>I can’t undo the things I’ve done, no matter how badly I want to, and every day is a constant reminder of my epic failure. Especially her.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s as if Demi has been put on this earth to punish me. To inflict more torture and pain. Because every second I’m around her, she makes me feel things I don’t want to feel. So, I lash out. Doing my best to push her away.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until I realize she’s everything I never knew I needed, and the fight becomes a new battle - one to win her heart.&nbsp;</p> <p>Due to mature content and themes, this book is recommended to listeners ages 18 and over. This is a slightly extended version of the version that appeared in the Bully Me anthology, containing one extra chapter and two epilogues and ending with a HEA and no cliff-hanger.</p>";
