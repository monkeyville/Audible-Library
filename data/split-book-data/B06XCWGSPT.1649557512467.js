window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kyle Issac is a player in the biggest of ways. He's not into relationships. Fun is all he wants, but one night with his sister's best friend changed him in ways he can't explain. Maybe because she was the only girl who turned him on and then shot him down. Maybe because she's off limits in a way that has him wanting more of her. He's not sure but something definitely changed and now he's looking for another chance to even the scoreboard. He's got one summer to do it. </p><p>Emily Emerson is not a relationship-type girl like her best friend Madison Issac. However after her newest fling gone wrong, she's starting to realize the fun, carefree Em is lost. Maybe a relationship is the kind of thing she needs to get herself out of this funk. But Kyle Issac, her forever crush, is not going to be it. The longest he's dated a girl was a weekend, tops. How can she find someone though if Kyle is always there butting in? So, she turned him down three times, she figured he'd get over it and move on. Apparently not. </p><p>With wants and doubts confusing her, one question remains. Does Kyle really want her or is she just another game for him to win? </p>";
