window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is it about men anyway? Bad cars, bad jobs, even bad teeth - nothing convinces them that they can't snare a size-two babe with a D-cup chest. And after way too many Internet dates with men named \"luvstick\" and \"bigdaddy182\", Lucy Rothschild should know. </p> <p>But sitting across from her now is \"hardluvnman\", and he seems different - sensitive, honest, and hot! He says he's a plumber while Lucy claims she's a nurse. She's really a mystery writer, dating online while researching her next book. Hey, everyone lies a little, don't they? </p> <p>But Quinn is really an undercover cop hunting down a serial killer, and he sees Lucy as his top suspect. While he could really go for this smart, sexy woman with the killer bod - if that's the only thing \"killer\" about her - he knows he needs to wine and dine her and discover the truth. Hey, he realizes the dating scene can be deadly - but this is ridiculous! </p>";
