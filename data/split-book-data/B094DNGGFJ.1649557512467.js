window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If happiness is a gift, then Cameron Stanton is my Santa Claus.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>I can’t tell you the exact moment I fell in love with him. Only that I did.With every glance, every touch, every minute...he stole a little more of me.&nbsp;</p> <p>They say that all men are created equal. Well, that’s a blatant lie! I know, because I met God's gift to women in Vegas; I pretended he was my husband to get rid of another man. He took our fake marriage seriously, and it became his personal goal to consummate. He spoke to me in French, and I lied to him in German. His laughter was addictive. But I thought what happens in Vegas would stay in Vegas. Until it didn't.</p> <p>Dr. Stanton turned up where I least expected, and my lies came back to haunt me. The attraction is palpable. The secrets unchangeable. I need him more than air.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a stand-alone contemporary romance.</p>";
