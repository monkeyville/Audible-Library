window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A trade summit on Corellia brings Han Solo back to the home planet he left many years before. Arriving on the distant planet with Leia, their children, and Chewbacca, Han finds Corellia overrun with agents of the New Republic Intelligence and finds himself part of a deceptive plan whose aim not even he understands. One thing is clear: the five inhabited worlds of the sector are on the brink of civil war, and the once peaceful co-existence of the three leading species - human, Selonian, and Drallan - has come to an end.</p>Suddenly all that Han, Leia, and others of the Alliance have fought for is threatened. As jammerships block all communication with Luke Skywalker and the outside universe, Han and Leia find themselves trapped on a world about to explode in violence unless they can meet a fanatical rebel leader's impossible demands. <p></p>";
