window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Penelope Ward comes a new stand-alone, second-chance story of forbidden love....</p> <p>It’s natural to want the one you can’t have. And for as long as I could remember, I’d secretly wanted my brother’s best friend, Jace.</p> <p>He was six years older and always treated me like the sister he never had.</p> <p>Fast forward a decade.</p> <p>We were all in our 20s now. Jace had moved in with my brother, Nathan, and me to help us make ends meet after our parents died.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was just the three of us - an odd family dynamic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Living under our roof, Jace was as bossy and protective as ever.&nbsp;</p> <p>But he certainly didn’t look at me like a sister anymore. That was what made things so complicated.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was pretty much hot and bothered 24/7.&nbsp;</p> <p>And he was torn.</p> <p>The signs were subtle at first. Like on movie night, I’d casually rest my leg against his, and he wouldn’t exactly shift away.</p> <p>Still, I assumed he would never...go there.</p> <p>Nathan would kill us.</p> <p>The knowledge of that wasn’t enough to stop the inevitable, though.</p> <p>Eventually our slow burn exploded.&nbsp;</p> <p>But more than the physical attraction, we’d developed a strong connection.&nbsp;</p> <p>We just couldn’t get caught, right?</p> <p>That sounded simple.</p> <p>Until it wasn’t.</p> <p>This is a story of forbidden love, broken trust, and an unexpected second chance.</p>";
