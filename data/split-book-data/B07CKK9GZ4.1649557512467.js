window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A wallflower gets seduction tips from a playboy athlete - until love changes the rules.</b></p> <p>Socially awkward Joellen Bixby has a date every Saturday - with her cat, a pint of ice cream, and fantasies of the way-too-handsome Michael Maddox. She’d give anything to win over the unattainable CEO of her firm, but how can she when she blends in so well with her cubicle? The answer may be closer than she thinks.</p> <p>Cameron McGregor is a cocky, tattooed Scottish rugby captain who just moved in next door. He’s not Jo’s type - <i>at all</i> - but the notorious playboy <i>is</i> offering to teach the wallflower everything he knows about inspiring desire. Though a lot of women have rumpled Cam’s kilt, Jo is special. Far from the ugly duckling she thinks she is, in Cam’s eyes she’s sharp, funny, and effortlessly sexy. Now, thanks to him, Jo is blooming with confidence and has the man of her dreams within reach.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Cam, he’s just helped to push the woman of <i>his</i> dreams into the arms of another man - and now he’s in the fight of his life to keep this beauty from getting away.</p>";
