window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Happy Cat, Georgia, where the men are hot, the romance is swoon-worthy, and the animals don’t play by the rules. This box set includes four stand-alone but linked romantic comedies, as well as a bonus novella featuring a British single dad who’s head-over-heels for his nanny.</p> <p>About the books:</p> <p><i>Hosed </i>is a steamy romantic comedy featuring a firefighter and the virgin nerd next door, complete with a pet raccoon, scandalous gossip, and dildo football. (No, really.)</p> <p><i>Hammered </i>is a tipsy fun romance featuring a grumpy bartender and his rainbows-and-sunshine secret crush, complete with a panty-stealing hedgehog, the world’s best wedding rescue, and love saving the day.</p> <p><i>Hitched </i>is a red-hot, enemies-to-lovers laugh-a-palooza featuring a girl in need of a marriage of convenience and a man in need of a cold shower to keep from falling for his fake wife. They say opposites attract, but in this case, they also combust.</p> <p><i>Humbugged </i>is a laugh-out-loud holiday romp featuring a Marine with a heart of gold and a baker in need of a hero. Complete with the world's most awkward Christmas caroling, a photo shoot with furry friends, and more naughty baked goods than is good or decent.</p> <p><i>Happily Ever Aftered</i> is a steamy novella featuring a nanny in search of true love, a hot British single dad, and all the animal and town shenanigans you’ve come to expect from Happy Cat.</p>";
