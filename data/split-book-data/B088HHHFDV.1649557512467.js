window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>USA Today</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> best-selling author Meagan Brandy delivers a new stand-alone fake-relationship romance about finding light when your world is dark and fighting for love when all seems lost.</p> <p>Fake. That's what we are. That's what we agreed to be. So why does it feel so real?</p> <p>I thought it would have been harder, convincing everyone our school's star receiver was mine and mine alone, but I was wrong. We played our parts so well that the lines between us began to blur until they disappeared completely.</p> <p>The thing about pretending, though, is that someone's always better at it, and by the time I realized my mistake, there was no going back.</p> <p>I fell for our lie. And then everything fell apart.</p> <p>It turned out he and I were never playing the same game. He didn't have to break me to win. But he did it anyway.</p> <p>This is a 98,000-word enemies-to-lovers complete stand-alone romance!</p>";
