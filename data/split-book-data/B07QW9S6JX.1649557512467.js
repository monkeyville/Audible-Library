window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first rule of working together? Don't fall for the boss' daughter. Definitely don't fall for her when you're trying to buy the business.</b></p> <p>The trouble is Sloane is smack dab next to me from nine to freaking five. And she's as captivating, brilliant, and sexy as ever, which means I'm taking more than the recommended dosage of office romance temptation every day. Make that every single second, because she's not only \"the one\" - she's the one who got away.&nbsp;</p> <p>But she's the very definition of off-limits, so I keep my hands to myself. Fine, we might flirt. Okay, we do indulge in the occasional dirty text. And there was that one time when we kissed on the street. But we've been good since then.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until the night she issues me a challenge - seven nights of O lessons and then we walk away.</p> <p>Sounds like a simple arrangement.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>But I was never good with those kind of rules.</b></p> <p>This innovative new production includes the full-length novel of <i>Satisfaction Guaranteed</i>, as well as an album! At the end of the story, you'll be treated to an album of classic love songs you know and love performed by Jason Clarke in a fully produced musical performance that ties into the story line!&nbsp;</p> <p>The songs included in the album are standards made famous by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Ella Fitzgerald, and Marilyn Monroe and include \"The Curse of an Aching Heart\", \"After You've Gone\", \"Baby, Won't You Please Come Home\", \"I Ain't Got Nobody (And Nobody Cares for Me)\", \"After You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It\", \"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\", and \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\". &nbsp;</p>";
