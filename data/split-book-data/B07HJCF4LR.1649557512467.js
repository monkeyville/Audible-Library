window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Oaklee Ryan needs a boyfriend, but not for any of the reasons you might think. It’s a simple request. But the girl...well, she’s not so simple.&nbsp;</p> <p>Oaklee Ryan is a pragmatist. She lives in reality, she deals with facts, and she’s goal-oriented. So when she paid a visit to Jordan Wells asking for a game, calling it, “The Boyfriend Experience”, he thought he knew what she was getting at.</p> <p>Wining, dining, maybe a date to a wedding to appease her meddling mother....</p> <p>No. That’s not quite what Oaklee had in mind.</p> <p>Lawton Gabriel took this game as a favor to his friend. It only took him five minutes to regret it. Oaklee Ryan is insane. She’s loud, she’s demanding, and she’s dead set on getting her way.</p> <p>If she thinks he’s going to turn into her version of a boyfriend...just. No. He’ll do anything it takes to get out of this crazy contract!</p> <p>Includes a special bonus note read by the author.</p>";
