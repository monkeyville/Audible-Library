She needs my late-night expertise. Now, if we can just keep our hands off each other....</b></p> <p>As the premier best-man-for hire in all of Manhattan, I promise discretion, so when I need a plus one for a couple of \"I dos\", I turn to my gorgeous, clever, witty best friend’s sister. She’s my good friend, too, and I lust after her completely. I mean, I <i>trust </i>her completely.</p> <p>After all, just look how she’s kept her lips sealed about the hot, multi-O night we spent together. Yes, just look at those sexy lips.</p> <p>In any case, we only fell off the wagon once, and it was months ago. I’m sure we can make it through these weddings without banging each other in the limo.</p> <p>Or can we?</p> <p><b>This special production also includes a behind-the-scenes conversation with Andi Arndt and Shane East as well as a blooper reel!</b></p>";
