She shouldn’t have barged into my world with no armor. She shouldn’t have caught my attention with no warning. Alas, she did. Then she thought she could disappear. If a battle is what it’ll take to protect and own her, I’ll shed blood. Wars aren’t fair, and neither am I.</p> <p><i>Rise of a Queen</i> is the second part of a duet and is not stand-alone.</p>";
