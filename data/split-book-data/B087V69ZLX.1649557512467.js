window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Indulge in the first ever collection of all four standalone romances in the Caught Up In Love series, with narration from Sebastian York, Andi Arndt, Joe Arden, Zachary Webber, Vanessa Edwin and Emma Wilder!</p> <p><i>The Pretending Plot</i></p> <p>I don't mean to just blurt it out. \"Why, yes, I'm engaged!\" But once I say it to a potential client, there's only one logical thing to do - cast the role of my fake fiancé. Easy enough. As a casting director, my job is to find the most talented players for every part, so I choose dreamy, edgy, sexy, sarcastic Reeve. And I sign him up for one week in the role of mine....</p> <p><i>The Dating Proposal</i></p> <p>The&nbsp;seven years I invested in my ex left me with nothing but scorch marks from the way he peeled out and left me at the altar. I'm not looking to put my heart into a relationship any time soon. But getting back out there? That sounds like a helluva good idea to get my groove back.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then I bump into Chris...</p> <p><i>The Second Chance Plan</i></p> <p>I have a big plan for my career and it most certainly doesn’t involve my ex. AKA my first love.&nbsp;It definitely doesn’t entail working with him every day on a brand-new project for my jewelry line.&nbsp;And it absolutely doesn’t include falling for the man all over again.</p> <p><i>The Private Rehearsal</i></p> <p>The first rule of directing is simple: Never fall for your leading lady.</p> <p>The second? Don’t let it get to you when she stage kisses another man.</p> <p>Looks like I’ve already broken both...</p>";
