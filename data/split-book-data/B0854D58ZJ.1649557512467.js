window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“How long do you last in bed?” Those were her first words to me, swiftly followed up with, “And how big would you say you are?”</p> <p>Cue the record scratching, what?</p> <p>Persephone Alexander. Math genius. Lover of blazers. The only girl I know who can make Heidi braids look sexy as hell. And she’s on a mission. Lose her virginity by the end of the semester.&nbsp;</p> <p>I walked in on her interview session for potential candidates (who even does that?) and saw straight through her brave front. She’s got a list of firsts to accomplish, like she’s only got months to live.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ve decided to be her guide for all her firsts, except one. Someone’s got to keep her out of trouble. I have one rule, no sex. We even shook on it.</p> <p>I’ll help her find the right guy for the job. Someone like her doesn’t need someone like me and my massive...baggage for her first time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Drinking at a bar. Check.&nbsp;</p> <p>Partying all night. Double check.&nbsp;</p> <p>Skinny dipping. Triple check.&nbsp;</p> <p>She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met. The walls I’d put up around my heart are slowly crumbling with each touch that sets fire to my soul.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m the first to bend the rules. One electrifying kiss changes everything, and suddenly, I don’t want to be her first, I want to be her only. But her plan was written before I came onto the scene, and now, I’m determined to get her to rewrite her future with me.</p>";
