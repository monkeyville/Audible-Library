window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Crimson Elite, the most exclusive sex club in the world. Enter at your own risk, and always remember our number-one rule: You must never speak of Crimson Elite - the punishment is severe.&nbsp;</p> <p>If God created the perfect man he would closely resemble Creed, on the outside that is. He’s as cavalier as they come. Unconcerned. Cold. Dismissive. I wonder if he has any feelings at all. And when his lips touch mine, everything goes black. He takes me into his world, and it’s the most magical thing I’ve ever experienced. And I’m sucked in time and time again. Like a moth to the flame, I am ready to be set alight.&nbsp;</p> <p>Elicea is a firecracker. She has piqued my interest, and no one piques my interest anymore. Beautiful women are what I do - it’s my work. Not one of them has managed to get their claws into me the way she does. It’s as if she’s seeing my icy heart and trying to melt it, set it alight with each touch of her sinful lips. But that can’t work, it won’t work. Not in my world.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>All books in the series can be listened to as stand-alone stories.</i></p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
