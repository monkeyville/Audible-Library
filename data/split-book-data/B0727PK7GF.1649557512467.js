window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most people called it a cult. But for 20 years, Josh and Caleb called it home. In Paradise, there is no television. No fast food. Just long hours of farmwork and prayer on a dusty Wyoming ranch and nights in a crowded bunkhouse. The boys of the Compound are kept far from the sinners' world. But Joshua doesn't need temptation to sin. His whole life he's wanted his best friend, Caleb. By day they work side by side. Only when Josh closes his eyes at night can they be together the way he craves. It can never be. And his survival depends on keeping his terrible desires secret. </p> <p>Caleb has always protected Josh against the worst of the bullying at the Compound. But he has secrets of his own and a plan to get away - until it all backfires. Josh finds himself homeless in a world that doesn't want him. Can Caleb find him in time? And will they find a place of safety, where he can admit to Josh how he really feels? </p> <p>Warning: Contains a hot male/male romance, copious instances of taking the Lord's name in vain, and love against the kitchen counter. This book was previously released under the title <i>In Front of God and Everyone</i>. </p>";
