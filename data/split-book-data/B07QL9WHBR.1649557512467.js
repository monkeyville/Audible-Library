window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Corinne Michaels comes a new story in her Salvation series...</p> <p>I was poised to become partner at my law firm even before I became secretly engaged to my boss. After being humiliated by him on my wedding day, I can’t face working for him any longer. So I quit, waving my middle finger on my way out.</p> <p>Now the only things I’m poised for are unemployment and loneliness.</p> <p>When an opportunity with Cole Security arises, it seems like the perfect way to run, all the way to Virginia Beach. I wasn’t expecting my childhood sweetheart to be there. I definitely wasn’t prepared that when we saw each other again, Benjamin Pryce would be so grown-up. So gorgeous. So Navy SEAL-ish.</p> <p>And still the same guy who broke my heart when I was fifteen - and could do it again.</p> <p>They say if you’re fooled once, shame on them. The second time, it’s on you. The third time, it’s going to be me that runs...unless he can convince me to stay forevermore.</p> <p>**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new listeners, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</p>";
