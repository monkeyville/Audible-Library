window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The billionaire always gets what he wants. This time, he wants me....</b></p> <p>My trip to London was the first lucky break I've had in years. It came at just the right time, allowing me to escape my sad reality for a bit. And the guy I met on the flight? Perfection. The short week we spent together was filled with raw, unbridled, and passionate nights. But it couldn't last. I'm a single mom with a troubled past and a shady ex. Romance just isn't in the cards for me. Which is why I walked away from Jim and didn't look back.</p> <p>That was before I landed my new job. Before I met the boss. Before I discovered that Mr. James Mitchell, CEO, was my Jim - my unforgettable Jim from our week together in England. Judging by the smile on his face when he sees me, he remembers everything. And now he wants more. He wants me.&nbsp;</p> <p>The timing is terrible. My life's a mess, and I just know my ex will do something to ruin me. Again. But none of that matters when I'm in Jim's arms.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, what are the odds that I'm finally due for my very own happily ever after?</p> <p>With my luck? Not bloody likely.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
