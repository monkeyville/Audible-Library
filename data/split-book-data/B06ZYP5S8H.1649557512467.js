Now they have to fool everyone and pretend they actually like each other. </p> <p>Tanner Harris has been busy shagging his way through the ladies of east London, but getting caught by the paparazzi buck-naked with his trouser snake in his hands means he's sowed his last wild oat. </p> <p>Dr. Belle Ryan once thought Tanner Harris was the perfect kind of bearded bad boy she needed to relieve a bit of stress after her intense job as a surgical fellow, but an icy cold rejection from London's sluttiest footballer puts the two at each other's throats. </p> <p>Fate and a favor conspire to put Tanner and Belle back in each other's paths and they're forced to do a lot more than get along to save face and their careers. </p> <p>Rage turns to passion and tempers run sizzling hot when they realize they aren't just falling for each other - they're jumping head first. And neither have the endurance to keep their hands to themselves. </p>";
