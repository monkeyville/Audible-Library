window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Journey to <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i> with this exclusive short story featuring a quick-witted mercenary who takes big risks for bigger rewards - and now faces the challenge that will take her to the edge. </p> <p>There are plenty of mercenaries, spies, and guns for hire in the galaxy. But probably none as dangerous and determined as Bazine Netal. A master of disguise - and lethal with a blade, a blaster, or bare handed - she learned from the best. Now it's her turn to be the teacher - even if schooling an eager but inexperienced recruit in the tricks of her trade is the last thing she wants to do. But it's the only way to score the ship she needs to pull off her latest job. </p> <p>An anonymous client has hired Bazine to track down an ex-stormtrooper and recover the mysterious package he's safeguarding. Payment for the mission promises to be astronomical, but the obstacles facing Bazine will prove to be formidable. And though her eager new sidekick has cyber skills crucial to the mission, only Bazine's razor-sharp talents will mean the difference between success and failure - and life and death. </p>";
