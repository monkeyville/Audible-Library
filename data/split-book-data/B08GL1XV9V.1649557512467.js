Instead, I locked her in, and with the promise I would never be hers.</p> <p>I resisted, fought against us. I caved. I tasted what became my newfound favorite flavor and fell hard for the little liar.</p> <p>But then the depth of her treachery reveals itself, and with it a reminder.</p> <p>Our town is a twisted place, and with truth comes trouble.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, my world is split at its core, and I’m faced with an impossible decision, one that leads to a single outcome: betrayal.</p> <p>This is Captain Brayshaw's book and the fourth book in the Brayshaw series.</p>";
