window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Sidney Hale, rescuing dogs is more than a hobby. It’s a calling. A deep-seated need. An unstoppable compulsion. For reasons so unsettling, she shares them with no one…until she meets Decker. After coming to her rescue while Sidney battled to save a dog - literally - the gorgeous SEAL proves he can be trusted with her secrets, her safety…maybe even her heart.&nbsp;</p> <p>Saving an abused pit bull from a suspected dog fighter brings Decker “Gumby” Kincade not only the dog he’s always wanted, but the first woman in ages to catch his interest. Sidney’s reason for rescuing Hannah, and animals like her, is shocking…but it makes Gumby want her even more. Her harrowing past has made her the strong, brave, compassionate woman she is today. She could be The One…if Gumby can help curb her habit of putting herself squarely in danger’s path.&nbsp;</p> <p>But he may be too late. Hannah’s previous owner is enraged over her loss…and looking for revenge.&nbsp;</p> <p>*<i>Securing Sidney</i> is the second book in the SEAL of Protection: Legacy series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>This story examines the stark reality of dogfighting and other animal abuse, and includes brief descriptions that may be unpleasant for some listeners.</i></p>";
