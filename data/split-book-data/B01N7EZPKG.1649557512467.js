window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first in a smart, sizzling new contemporary romance series by <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Mira Lyn Kelly. </p> <p>Jase Foster is as loyal and committed as a friend can get - when it comes to the guys, that is. But with women he keeps it casual and experiences what one would call a \"high turnover rate\". </p> <p>Emily Klein is beautiful and confident...and has mile-long legs that have been strutting in and out of Jase's life since adolescence, leaving a wake of destruction. As they get paired up time after time as the best man and maid of honor in the upcoming nuptials of all of their best friends, Emily and Jase find their mutual resentment simmering just beneath the surface...right alongside their mutual attraction. Committed to maintaining order for their friends' sakes, they keep their personal loathing for each other under wraps...at least so long as they have an audience. But once they're alone... </p>";
