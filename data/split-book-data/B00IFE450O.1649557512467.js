window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This complete collection of The Billionaire's Obsession includes: <i>Mine For Tonight</i>, <i>Mine For Now</i>, <i>Mine Forever</i>, <i>Mine Completely</i> </p> <p>Down-on-her-luck nursing student and full-time waitress Kara Foster gets a massive blow to her already desperate financial situation that will surely find her living on the streets. Needing nothing less than a miracle to save her, Kara gets rescue from an unknown, unlikely, and overwhelming source. Billionaire Simon Hudson makes her an offer that is impossible to refuse, but terrifying to accept from a man that she's never met. Will the handsome, alpha billionaire really be a solution to her problems? Or will he end up being a major complication and a danger to her emotional sanity? </p> <p>Reclusive billionaire Simon Hudson would rather be behind a computer creating computer games than rubbing elbows with the elite and he knows exactly what he wants...until he meets Kara Foster. Something about Kara touches Simon in ways he's never experienced and definitely doesn't like. For over a year, Simon watches over Kara, but stubbornly refuses to admit his desire to possess her, not even to himself. But when she ends up in a situation that could very well be her destruction, Simon steps up to help her, not realizing that in saving Kara, he might very well be salvaging his own soul. </p> <p>This is an erotic romance and is not intended for YA listeners. It contains graphic language, explicit sex, and other subjects not appropriate for YA listeners.</p>";
