window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nominee, 2018 Audie Awards â€” Erotica</p> <p>I've never been afraid of the dark...but that doesn't mean I wanted to live in it. And maybe everyone wants what they can't have, but I should've thought it over before I accepted the key and unlocked the door to their forbidden world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Number One is mostly silent. He watches me with them very carefully. His gaze never wanders. His interest never wanes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Number Two is mostly gentle. But it's the other side of him I like best. The wild side.&nbsp;</p> <p>Number Three is mostly reserved. He refuses to cross the line. Even when I beg.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was carnal, it was sensual, and it was erotic. That's it. That's all it was supposed to be. A trip into the dark. A peek into the forbidden.&nbsp;</p> <p>I just didn't expect to like them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Includes a special bonus note read by the author.&nbsp;</p>";
