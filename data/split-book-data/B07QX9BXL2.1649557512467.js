Then shame sent her running the next morning from our catastrophic mistake.&nbsp;</p> <p>She thinks I don't remember that night - but every detail is burned into my brain so deeply, I’ll never forget. The feel of her in my arms, the soft whimpers of pleasure I coaxed from her perfect lips....</p> <p>And now I’ve spent three months trying to get her out of my head, but I’m starting to understand she’s the only girl I’ll ever want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I have one shot to show her I can be exactly what she needs, but Elise won’t be easily convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s okay, because I’m good under pressure, and this time, I’m playing for keeps.&nbsp;</p>";
