window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the war between the Republic and the scattered remnants of the Empire continues, two children, the Jedi twins, will come into their powers in a galaxy on the brink of vast changes and challenges. In this time of turmoil and discovery, an extraordinary new <i>Star Wars</i> saga begins. </p> <p>While Luke Skywalker takes the first step toward setting up an academy to train a new order of Jedi Knights, Han Solo and Chewbacca are taken prisoner on the planet Kessel and forced to work in the fathomless depths of a spice mine. But when Han and Chewie break away, they flee to a secret Imperial research laboratory surrounded by a cluster of black holes - going from one danger to a far greater one.</p> <p>On Kessel, Luke picks up the trail of his two friends, only to come face to face with a weapon so awesome it can wipe out an entire solar system. It is a death ship called the Sun Crusher, invented by a reclusive genius and piloted by none other than Han himself.</p>";
