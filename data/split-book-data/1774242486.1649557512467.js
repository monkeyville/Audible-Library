window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Six years before my phone rang and changed my life forever, I made a mistake.</b></p> <p>I met a girl, we had some fun, and then we had a baby. And I fell pretty damn hard for my daughter. I was going to be there. I was going to give her everything I never had. I was going to have a family.</p> <p>And then her mother disappeared and took my baby with her.</p> <p>And now she’s done it again. Because that call that changed my life was from my five-year-old daughter asking me if I knew where her Mommy was.</p> <p>Then came the lawyers. And the demands from her super-rich, super-powerful, messed-up family. And the little fact that my ex didn’t just “disappear” she was “presumed dead”.</p> <p>I don’t live a traditional lifestyle and I’m not in a traditional relationship.</p> <p><b>But I can pretend if I have to.</b></p> <p>And that was the plan when my two “best friends” and I decided to hire “professional liar” Brooke Alder to be my fake fiancée.</p> <p>It’s totally gonna work. As long as MY super-rich, super-powerful, messed-up family doesn’t get in the way.</p> <p><i>Joey</i> is book two in the Bossy Brothers series and features a delicious, burning hot, MMFM, surprise-baby, fake fiancée story with a twist that proves committed couples don’t just come in twos, mistakes can be a good thing, and for some people - non-traditional love is exactly the kind they should fight for.</p> <p>Includes a special bonus note from the author.</p>";
