window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There’s no halftime in hockey, but maybe there’s one in love....</b></p> <p>Drunk dialing your girlfriend to tell her that you didn’t really cheat is a bad idea - a lesson Seb Hunter learned the hard way. It was no surprise when she cut him completely out of her life. Now, he’s finally moved on, and he’s looking forward to sophomore year at Moo U. Until his ex arrives on campus.&nbsp;</p> <p>For goalie Faith Devereaux, cheating is a hard pass. She grew up knowing all too well how destructive infidelity can be. She’s gotten over Seb and picked the college of her dreams. The fact that he’s a student there will not be a problem. Hockey is her priority. Not guys, not dating, and definitely not exes.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when an exhibition game forces them into close proximity, it isn’t long before their old attraction flares. Regaining trust is hard, though, when the heart plays a good defensive game.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when the goal is love, one more shot might be all they need.</p>";
