window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nobody puts Quinn in a corner.</p> <p><b>Quinn</b></p> <p>Just six years old when my brother was snatched off the street, I grew up in the aftermath of tragedy. While other kids were happily playing in the sandbox, I was hiding under press conference podiums listening to my parents beg for Jake’s safe return. People ask if I’m screwed up after what happened, and I never know how to respond. Life after the kidnapping is all I’ve ever known. Well, that and being the youngest brother to a rock star. Jake was the ultimate survivor. The prodigal son. My king.</p> <p>But I’m not that worshipful kid anymore, and I’m tired of walking a step behind. I’ve got the talent. I’ve got the drive. And now, I’m coming for Jake’s throne.</p> <p><b>Jess</b></p> <p>What to do with a runaway rock star in my passenger seat?</p> <p>Jess of yore would’ve jumped at the chance. Hell, she’d already be in his lap by now. She was fearless and fun and sexy. She lived like there was no tomorrow...until tomorrow came calling and delivered her an ultimatum: repent or risk losing it all. And so, responsible Jess was born, the good girl who paid her rent, and watered her plants, and put others before herself.&nbsp;</p> <p>The new, improved version of myself represented stability and a roof overhead. Yet, sometimes... sometimes, I missed that reckless girl. Wild Jess. God, she’d been so fun. And now, Quinn was here, built like a god and asking me to play. One mindless afternoon of fun. Surely I could spare that for a future rock legend. I could bring old Jess back for just one day.</p> <p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>";
