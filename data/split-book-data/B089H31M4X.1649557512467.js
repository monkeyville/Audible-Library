window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Did Mike accidentally drown in a Florida lake? Or was his disappearance the result of a sinister plot to kill him?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The crisp, predawn hours of December 16, 2000, began much as they had many Saturdays for avid duck hunter Mike Williams — on Lake Seminole, where he’d go to relax after a stressful work week. The Florida State grad was juggling fatherhood with a thriving real estate appraisal career. And that very evening? He and his high school sweetheart, Denise, planned to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But Mike Williams never returned home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When an intense search of the lake’s marshy waters turned up only his hunting boat and a camouflage hat, investigators reached the morbid conclusion he’d fallen overboard and drowned, his body eaten by alligators. Nearly two decades passed before the dark secrets hidden at Lake Seminole — and elsewhere — were finally revealed.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Evil at Lake Seminole</i> is a diabolical tale of betrayal, greed, and deception — and of a courageous mother who devoted her life and savings to uncovering the truth of what really happened to her son.</p>";
