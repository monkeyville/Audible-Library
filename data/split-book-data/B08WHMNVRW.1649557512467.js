window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sexy, falling for my brother's best friend sports romance from number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller Lauren Blakely and performed by Erin Mallon and Teddy Hamilton! </b></p> <p>Let me make a few things clear. I didn't go to the wedding intending to dance with the best man, to dare him to show me a very sexy pic on his phone, or to accidentally kiss him in the hotel elevator after the reception ended.</p> <p>But you know how it goes. Things just happen at weddings....</p> <p>The next day, Crosby and I agree to put all those shenanigans behind us. The fun-loving, stupidly gorgeous all-star baseball player might be my brother's best friend, but he's my friend too and has been for years, so it's easy to move on, especially since I have a high-profile business to run.&nbsp;</p> <p>But since he's newly single and I'm always single, it turns out we both desperately need plus ones. We agree to \"publicly date\" over the next week of galas, parties, and events before his baseball season begins.</p> <p>The only trouble is the more time I spend with Crosby, the more I keep imagining how much I want him to take my V-card. And when I broach the possibility with Crosby, his answer surprises the hell out of me.</p>";
