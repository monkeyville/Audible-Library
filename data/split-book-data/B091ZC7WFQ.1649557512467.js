Otherwise, she would’ve had an idea of just how hard some things could be.</p> <p>It turns out that pretending to be in love with a crazily handsome, somewhat enigmatic, and absolutely unforgettable tight end (that has an amazing tight end) is easy.</p> <p>Reminding herself that just because opposites attract doesn’t mean they’re forever is much harder.</p> <p>What they have isn’t love - it’s a relationship pact. Right?</p> <p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: <i>The Relationship Pact</i> is a fun and flirty college sports romance with lots of heart.
