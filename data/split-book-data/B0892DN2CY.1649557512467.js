window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Legion Dark Ops has always been a unit shrouded in secrecy. Tasked with performing covert missions, its kill teams are filled with the best warriors from within the ranks of the Legion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Kel Turner is one of the youngest legionnaires ever to be selected to its ranks. After many battles and trials, he is faced with the greatest challenge of his life - operating by himself on a remote planet at the galaxy's edge, a foot soldier for the policies of the duplicitous House of Reason, tasked with solving a crisis that would take ten kill teams to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Diplomats, spies, shadowy terrorist groups, and an enigmatic general work with and against Kel as he fights to save a society from itself. What can one operator do alone, separated from his kill team, fighting a war that has no name?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>This lone operator doesn't know what it will take to win. He only knows he's not going to lose.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
