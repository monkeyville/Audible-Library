window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Failure is a hateful word. </b></p> <p>For Dark Ops Sergeant Kel Turner, it’s unthinkable. Until now. Kill teams are accustomed to achieving the impossible, and Kill Team Three has done the impossible more than any other. Tasked with mission after mission against a never-ending list of enemies, Kel and Three brace themselves to rise to the occasion yet again.</p> <p>Kel lives under no doubts about his kill team’s ability to win against any odds, until an enemy thought long defeated reappears. From a dingy city locked in the center of a cold war to a nightmarish alien landscape, the one constant that defines their latest missions is that a kill team is always alone.</p> <p>Living in the black world of covert operations, there are secrets, then there are secrets. The first might lead to his death. The second might lead to failure.</p> <p>For this Dark Operator, in a galaxy filled with potentials, death is preferable to failure.</p>";
