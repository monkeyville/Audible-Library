window.bookSummaryJSON = "Fighting alongside the Corellian rebels, Han and Leia are locked in a war against their son, Jacen, who grows more powerful and more dangerous with each passing day. Nothing can stop Jacen's determination to bring peace with a glorious Galactic Alliance victory - whatever the price. <p>While Luke grieves the loss of his beloved wife and deals with the guilt over killing the wrong person in retaliation, Jaina, Jag, and Zekk hunt for the real assassin, unaware that the culprit commands Sith powers that can cloud their minds and misdirect their attacks - and even turn them back on themselves.</p> <p>As Luke and Ben Skywalker struggle to find their place among the chaos, Jacen, shunned by friends and family, launches an invasion to rescue the only person still loyal to him. But with the battle raging on, and the galaxy growing more turbulent and riotous, there's no question that it is Jacen who is most wanted - dead or alive.</p>";
