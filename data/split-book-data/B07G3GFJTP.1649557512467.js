window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Meet the Arizona Vengeance, hockey’s hottest new team. They’re burning up the ice - until a one-night stand with the coach’s daughter freezes one player in his skates. </b></p> <p>Bishop Scott, cocaptain. Not too shabby, huh? It’s all part of my fresh start with the NHL’s latest expansion team, and that means new teammates, a new coach, a new city, and a big new contract. Basically, I cannot f---ing wait to show my old squad what they’re missing.&nbsp;</p> <p>But first, I decide to check out the town before the grind begins. Turns out Arizona chicks are totally smokin’, and I’m fortunate enough to meet one who’s looking for the same thing I am: a night of anonymous, unforgettable, no-strings-attached sex.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fast forward to the Vengeance arena. It’s the last place I expect to see her again - let alone <i>in her own office</i>. Then bells go off and I finally realize who this girl is: Brooke Perron. My new coach’s daughter. All of a sudden, we’re picking up right where we left off, which means our hands are all over each other. That’s when her dad - my boss - walks in. And before I can get a word out, Brooke’s introducing me as her <i>fiancé</i>.</p> <p>Sure, she just saved my ass. So why do I get the feeling Brooke’s going to turn my world upside down? Maybe it’s because this fake relationship feels way too real....</p>";
