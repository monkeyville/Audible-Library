His dim smile can't hide his inner turmoil and the people he views as family all suddenly feel like polite strangers. </p> <p>Except for one person. A girl with dark eyes and even darker hair. </p> <p>A girl who isn't even an option. </p> <p>At least, not anymore. </p> <p>Dre can't decide who she's going to listen to. Her heart, her head, or her body. Because two out of those three things have her heading right back to Logan's Beach. Closure is what she tells herself she's seeking, but when she unlocks doors that were never meant to be opened she soon discovers that when it comes to Samuel Clearwater, closure might never be an option. </p> <p>This is book six in the King Series and the second part of Preppy and Dre's story. </p>";
