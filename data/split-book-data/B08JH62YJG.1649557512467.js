window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Indulge in four best-selling stand-alone romances from number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller Lauren Blakely in the One Love Collection! Performed by Sebastian York, Andi Arndt, and Zachary Webber!</b></p> <p><i>The Sexy One</i></p> <p>Let me count the ways why falling into forbidden love is not my wisest move....</p> <ol> <li>She works with me every single day. Did I mention she's gorgeous, sweet, kind, and smart?</li> <li>She works in my home. Playing with my five-year-old daughter. Teaching my little girl. Cooking for my princess. Which means...</li> <li>She's the nanny. And that makes her completely off-limits.... But it doesn’t stop me from wanting her. All of her.</li> </ol> <p><i>The Hot One</i></p> <p>At first glance, stripping naked at my ex-girlfriend's place of work might not seem like the brightest way to win her heart again. But trust me on this count - she always liked me best without any clothes on. And sometimes you have to play to your strengths when you're fighting an uphill battle. As a lawyer, I know how to fight, and I'm prepared to fight hard for her. Because sometimes you need a second chance at first love.</p> <p><i>The Knocked up Plan</i></p> <p>There are three little words most guys don’t want to hear on the first date. Not those.... I mean these...“knock me up”.</p> <p>This single gal has had enough of the games, the BS, and the endless chase. I know what I want most, and it’s not true love. It’s a bun in the oven, and I’m not afraid to hit up my s-e-x-on-a-stick co-worker to do the job. Ryder is gorgeous, witty, and charming - and he’s also a notorious commitment-phobe. That makes him the perfect candidate to make a deposit in the bank of me.</p> <p>I won’t fall for him, he won’t fall for me, and there’s no way baby will make three.</p> <p>Right?</p> <p><i>Come as You Are</i></p> <p>I couldn’t have scripted a more perfect night.</p> <p>For one fantastic evening, at a masquerade party in the heart of Manhattan, I’m not the millionaire everyone wants a piece of. Fine - multimillionaire. But who’s counting all those commas? Not me, and not the most intriguing woman I've ever met, who happens to like dancing.</p>";
