window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>He's a Wall Street wolf. She's been hired to tame him. </i></p> <p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lauren Layne comes a wildly sexy novel of business and pleasure.</p> <p>Twenty-eight and filthy rich, Matt Cannon is the youngest broker on Wall Street. He may be a \"boy wonder\", but he's every inch a man. Ask any woman-any night. But when Matt's latest fling makes scandalous headlines, his clients get anxious, and his bosses at Wolfe Investments level an ultimatum: Keep his assets zipped, get a \"real\" girlfriend, and clean up his act. Only one woman can help Matt with something this hard.</p> <p>For PR genius Sabrina Cross, the best fixer in Manhattan, playing Matt's steady is going to be a challenge, even if it's just for show. They already have an explosive history, she can't stand the cocky party boy, and worse - she can't stop thinking about him. So who will dare to break her \"no touching\" rule first? Because when that happens, Matt and Sabrina's game of <i>let's pretend</i> will get so hot it could set both their reputations on fire.</p>";
