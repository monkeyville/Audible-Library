window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best seller Elle Kennedy brings you a sexy new Off-Campus novel that can be enjoyed as a stand-alone. </p> <p><b>She's good at achieving her goals....</b> </p> <p>College senior Sabrina James has her whole future planned out: graduate from college, kick butt in law school, and land a high-paying job at a cutthroat firm. Her path to escaping her shameful past certainly doesn't include a gorgeous hockey player who believes in love at first sight. One night of sizzling heat and surprising tenderness is all she's willing to give John Tucker, but sometimes one night is all it takes for your entire life to change. </p> <p><b>But the game just got a whole lot more complicated.</b> </p> <p>Tucker believes being a team player is as important as being the star. On the ice he's fine staying out of the spotlight, but when it comes to becoming a daddy at the age of 22, he refuses to be a bench warmer. It doesn't hurt that the soon-to-be mother of his child is beautiful, whip-smart, and keeps him on his toes. The problem is Sabrina's heart is locked up tight, and the fiery brunette is too stubborn to accept his help. If he wants a life with the woman of his dreams, he'll have to convince her that some goals can be made only with an assist. </p> <p>Cover design copyright Morten Gorm / Flamingo Books. </p>";
