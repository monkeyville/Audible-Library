window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author&nbsp;Michael A. Stackpole continues The New Jedi Order epic with <i>Dark Tide II: Ruin</i>,&nbsp;a thrilling Star Wars adventure in which&nbsp;the Jedi Knights must fight their most treacherous battle - against an unrelenting evil intent on devouring the galaxy....</p> <p>The alien Yuuzhan Vong have launched an attack on the worlds of the Outer Rim. They are merciless, without regard for life - and they stand utterly outside the Force. Their ever-changing tactics stump the New Republic military. Even the Jedi, once the greatest guardians of peace in the galaxy, are rendered helpless by this impervious foe - and their solidarity has begun to unravel.</p> <p>While Luke struggles to keep the Jedi together, Knights Jacen Solo and Corran Horn set off on a reconnaissance mission to the planet Garqi, an occupied world. There, at last, they uncover a secret that might be used to undermine the enemy - if only they can stay alive long enough to use it!</p>";
