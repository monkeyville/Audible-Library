window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When AJ and Logan walked into Yvette Nightingale’s bar, they didn’t expect to be there long. They certainly didn’t expect to be dancing with her, or having sex with her, or spending the night with her.</b></p> <p>Because they were sent there to kill her. Not fall for her. Not feel sorry for her. Not want to take care of her, or protect her, or be in to her.</p> <p>But sometimes, people enter your life for a reason. Sometimes, they even enter at the very moment you need them most. And Yvette Nightingale needs AJ and Logan.</p> <p>She needs them even more than they need her.</p> <p><i>In to Her</i> is hours of dirty smut, fantasy scenes with erotic toys, MFM and MMF ménage, and an angst-y HEA that will leave you guessing until the very last minutes. (This is not a love triangle.)</p> <p>Includes a special bonus note from the author.</p>";
