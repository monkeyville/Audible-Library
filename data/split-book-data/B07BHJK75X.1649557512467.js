window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They call me Zen-man, the cool-headed one, the protector. I keep an eye out for everyone, take them in, find them homes. They think I’m the calm and collected one, the self-assured one, the one who knows the way. They think they see me. They think they know me.</p> <p>But they’re all wrong, because inside I’m broken. I have a jagged hole in my soul I can’t fix, a festering blackness. I’ve been to the pits of hell, and nobody comes back unscathed. Life in foster care fucked me up, and now a thread is all that’s holding me together.</p> <p>So I sleep around and never date, keeping chicks away. One day I’ll snap, and when I do, there’s no telling who I might take down with me.</p> <p>All the same, there’s this one girl who won’t be scared away. Dakota. She’s hot, and I won’t deny I want her. But she keeps coming back, pushing me, trying to get me to talk, to open up to her.</p> <p>She has no idea she’s playing with fire. When the demons come, she’d better be far away from me, just like everyone else.</p> <p>Stand-alone novel. No cliff-hanger. Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature listeners only. Not intended for young listeners.</p> <p>Bonus! Includes <i>What I Want for Christmas</i>, a Zane and Dakota short story.</p>";
