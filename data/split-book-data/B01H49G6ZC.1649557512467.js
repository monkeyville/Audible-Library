window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sport she loves is out of reach. The boy she loves has someone else. What now? </p> <p>She expected to start Harkness College as a varsity ice hockey player. But a serious accident means that Corey Callahan will start school in a wheelchair instead. Across the hall, in the other handicapped-accessible dorm room, lives the too-delicious-to-be-real Adam Hartley, another would-be hockey star with his leg broken in two places. He's way out of Corey's league. Also, he's taken. Nevertheless, an unlikely alliance blooms between Corey and Hartley in the \"gimp ghetto\" of McHerrin Hall. </p> <p>Over perilously balanced dining hall trays and video games, the two cope with disappointments that nobody else understands. They're just friends, of course, until one night when things fall apart. Or fall together. </p> <p>All Corey knows is that she's falling. Hard. But will Hartley set aside his trophy girl to love someone as broken as Corey? If he won't, she will need to find the courage to make a life for herself at Harkness - one that does not revolve around the sport she can no longer play or the brown-eyed boy who's afraid to love her back. </p>";
