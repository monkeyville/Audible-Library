window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is Clare Wingate doing? One minute she's suffering in a pretty-in-pink gown she'll never wear again, and the next thing she knows, it's morning and she has the nastiest hangover of her life. </p> <p>To make matters worse, she's wearing nothing but a spritz of Escada and lying next to Sebastian Vaughan, her girlhood crush turned sexy, globe-trotting journalist. Somewhere between the toast and the toss of the bouquet, she got herself into a whole lot of trouble.</p> <p>Clare had the right to go wild - after all, she'd been knocked off her dyed-to-match shoes after finding her own fianc√© in a compromising position with the washing machine repairman. Clearly her society wedding is off. </p> <p>But Sebastian pushed all the wrong buttons - and some of the right ones. Clare is in no mood for love - not even for lust - and wants to forget about Sebastian and his six-pack abs ASAP. But he isn't in the mood to go away, and his kiss is impossible to forget.</p>";
