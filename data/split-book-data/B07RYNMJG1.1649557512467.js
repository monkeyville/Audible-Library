Tasked with protecting the Republic's interests on a mining world, the legionnaires face roadside ambushes, double-dealing locals, and constant sabotage.&nbsp;</p> <p>And the mission isn’t as straightforward as they thought it would be.&nbsp;</p> <p>As skirmishes escalate into coordinated ambushes and assaults, two squad leaders, Talon and Lankin, are forced to chase after the sparks threatening to ignite the entire populace into a full-blown insurgency.

In this stand-alone tale of combat, brotherhood, and sacrifice, these legionnaires will learn what it truly means to make the ultimate sacrifices for their friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>Experience this thrilling story of combat, brotherhood and sacrifice set in the Galaxy’s Edge universe as USAF veteran and retired police officer Josh Hayes teams up with Anspach &amp; Cole.
