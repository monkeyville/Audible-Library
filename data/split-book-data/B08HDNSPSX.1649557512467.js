I applied for a position working for a woman, or so I thought. But Julian Masters is definitely all man...the kind you dream of licking chocolate from.</p> <p>The first day was bad. The kids were the spawn of the devil and I spied through a window and caught him doing something obscene...and equally fascinating.</p> <p>The second day was worse, he caught me snooping in his bathroom cabinet in my skimpy pyjamas and all hell broke loose.</p> <p>On the third day, I ran over him in a golf cart.</p> <p>And by day four I had decided that I wanted that chocolate...all of it. Melted...on me.</p> <p>But intelligent, widowed Judges don’t fall for ditzy nannies. Or do they?</p>";
