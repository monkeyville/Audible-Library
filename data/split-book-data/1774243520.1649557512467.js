Sucked into a dark vortex of lies, hate, and deceit, and spat out by money, glitz, and power.</p> <p>There were things this little girl didn’t know, things she was about to find out and secrets that have been kept from her. Those secrets were guarded by the boys that were about to smash her world open and tear it all apart....</p> <p>He may be a Malum, but she is a Stuprum, born into this world but neglected by the choice of her mother. Her eyes may not glisten with stars, but they roar with fire, and when she finally reaches her peak, it’s that same fire that will burn. Them. All. Down.</p> <p>My name is Tillie Stuprum, and my story is not like the rest.</p> <p>Everything she thought she knew is a fabricated version of the truth. I’m Nate Riverside-Malum, the one your girl whispers about to her friends and whose initials are scratched down your back. Her story is not like the rest of them, because her story is dead.</p>";
