window.bookSummaryJSON = "Civil war rages as the Galactic Alliance, led by Cal Omas and the Jedi forces of Luke Skywalker, battles a confederation of breakaway planets that rally to the side of rebellious Corellia. Suspected of involvement in an assassination plot against Queen Mother Tenel Ka of the Hapes Consortium, Han and Leia Solo are on the run, hunted by none other than their own son, Jacen, whose increasingly authoritarian tactics as head of GA security have led Luke and Mara Skywalker to fear that their nephew may be treading perilously close to the dark side. But all Jacen wants is safety and stability for all - and he's prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. <p>As the strands of destiny draw ever more tightly together in a galaxy-spanning web, the shocking conclusion will shatter two families and cast a grim shadow over the future.</p>";
