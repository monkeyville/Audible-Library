window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to their kingdom....</b></p> <p>Cole Covington is the most popular heartbreaker at school.&nbsp;<br> Every guy wants to be him and every girl wants to screw him.&nbsp;<br> Except me. His devastatingly good looks, golden arm, and flirty smiles don't do it for me anymore, because I know what's lurking underneath the star quarterback's gorgeous armor.&nbsp;</p> <p>At least I thought I did.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes the most beautiful people hide the ugliest truths.&nbsp;<br> And sometimes the only way to save someone is to walk beside them through hell.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sawyer Church is the bible-thumping nerd of Royal Hearts Academy.&nbsp;<br> Girls pick on her and guys don't notice her. <br> Except me. <br> Sweet, curvy, and sarcastic, she's impossible to ignore. <br> No matter how much I try. <br> Everyone at school has her pegged as the chubby, Jesus-loving geek, but unlike them, Sawyer's real and never pretends to be someone she's not.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until I ask her to be my fake girlfriend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes the most beautiful souls hide the greatest pain. And sometimes the only way to save someone is to fight for them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is book 2 in the Royal Hearts Academy series. Please note: Although this is Cole and Sawyer's book, it's also a stand-alone.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning: </b><i>Royal Hearts Academy is a new adult/high school series of standalones filled with drama, a touch of angst, and boys who are bad to the bone. The characters are flawed. If you're looking for a safe, sweet romance with nice heroes and heroines who are perfect all the time, this series is </i>not<i> for you.</i></p>";
