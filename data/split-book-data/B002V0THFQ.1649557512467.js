window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the Imperial prison barge Purge - temporary home to 500 of the galaxy’s most ruthless killers, rebels, scoundrels, and thieves - breaks down in a distant, uninhabited part of space, its only hope appears to lie with a Star Destroyer found drifting, derelict, and seemingly abandoned. But when a boarding party from the Purge is sent to scavenge for parts, only half of them come back - bringing with them a horrific disease so lethal that within hours nearly all aboard the Purge die in ways too hideous to imagine.</p> <p>And death is only the beginning.</p> <p>The Purge’s half-dozen survivors - two teenage brothers, a sadistic captain of the guards, a couple of rogue smugglers, and the chief medical officer, the lone woman on board - will do whatever it takes to stay alive. But nothing can prepare them for what lies waiting aboard the Star Destroyer amid its vast creaking emptiness that isn’t really empty at all. For the dead are rising: Soulless, unstoppable, and unspeakably hungry.</p>";
