window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The devil came to me in disguise. Too bad I didn’t notice until it was far too late.</p> <p><b>Vanessa:</b></p> <p>The devil doesn’t always wear an evil mask. Sometimes, he appears in the most beautiful form. Like the super-hot bad boy with the dirty-blond hair and a wicked glint in his blue eyes who swept in out of nowhere, stealing all the air from my lungs. I thought he was my savior. But he’s my ruination. And he’s just taken a machete to my heart.</p> <p><b>Jackson:</b></p> <p>For years, my rage seethed under the surface. Hidden behind a cloudy haze of my poison of choice. But now, the fog has cleared. <br> And I’m out for blood. I will annihilate those responsible for taking my sister from me. Except he’s not here, so I go for the next best target. The woman he abandoned. Until it suited him to drag her into this messed-up elite world. Sucks to be her. Because when I’m done with Vanessa, she’ll wish she was dead.</p> <p>A stand-alone dark romance set in the Rydeville Elite world.
