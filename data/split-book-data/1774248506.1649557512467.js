Then she thought she could strut out my front door and my life, right after announcing she was my best friend's baby sister.</p> <p>\"<i>Give me a memory, Noah.</i>\"</p> <p>That's what she said...right after she rendered me stupid in the shadows at a wedding reception. I did everything I could to figure her out. She wore more veils of armor than I've seen in a lifetime. On the outside, she was strong and self-assured. But within those beautiful, guarded blues? She was laced with vulnerability and grief. She got the memory she wanted, but in the process, I was left branded.</p> <p>When she ran, I had no choice but to follow. Not only did I go after her, I chased her halfway around the world. Because when it comes to her, one memory isn't enough. It doesn't matter that there couldn't be a more opposite pair than us.</p> <p>But when my job came back to bite me in the ass, I wasn't the only one caught in the crossfire. It bought us memories no one was counting on. That's when all the veils were ripped off.</p>";
