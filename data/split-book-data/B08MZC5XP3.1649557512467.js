window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author Corinne Michaels comes the final poignant standalone love story in the Arrowood Brothers Series.</p> <p>Hollywood taught me everything I know about relationships - except how to be in one. As an actor, I became an expert at faking it. Faking that I wasn't affected by my childhood. Faking that I was okay. Faking that I knew how to save the day, the girl, the whole damn world.</p> <p>But I've always known the truth - I’m no one's hero.</p> <p>Until I’m forced to move back to Sugarloaf for six months, and Brenna Allen offers me a chance to prove otherwise. She’s everything I never knew I wanted, but can't have. Her broken heart, perfect face, and adorable children turn my world upside down. Instead of preparing for my next leading role, I’m directing a middle school play.</p> <p>All to make her smile.</p> <p>The more time I spend here, the more I want to stay. Build a life in this town that I swore I’d leave - for her.</p> <p>But when the world comes crashing down around us, I’m forced to decide if staying for her is the right choice or if leaving is better for the woman I love.</p>";
