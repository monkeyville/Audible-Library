window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One night of complete surrender is all it takes.</b></p> <p>Gareth Harris is Manchester United's reclusive star defender. He has control over all aspects of his life. But a lifetime of supporting his siblings and filling in for an emotionally absent father has taken its toll.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sloan Montgomery is a clothing stylist whose world was turned upside down when she found herself pregnant and moving to Manchester with a man who was never supposed to be her forever. Now recently divorced and struggling with shared custody of her daughter, control is a fleeting concept for this American living in England.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both Gareth and Sloan are in need of a release. A moment in time where they can forget about their pasts and family pressures...and just...surrender. No one could predict what happens when both of their defences are down.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Surrender </i>is part one of the Final Harris Brother Duet and concludes with <i>Dominate</i>. This duet is a great listen on its own, but to maximize enjoyment, check out the first three brothers books in <i>Challenge</i>,<i> Endurance</i>, and <i>Keeper</i>.</p>";
