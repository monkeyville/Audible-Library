Find out in this tender, laugh-out-loud-funny romance from number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Lauren Blakely, available in audio first!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p><i>Never Have I Ever</i> been so infuriated by a man I wanted to kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>They say opposites attract, but I beg to differ. Combust is more like it. Because every single time I talk to Zach Nolan, I see red.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The too-good-looking, too-smart, too-effortlessly-charming single dad who works down the hall from me has turned getting under my skin into a sport. Call it the battle of wits between the wedding planner and the divorce attorney.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trouble is, when we’re forced into closer quarters, planning an engagement party for our best friends, I start to see his other sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>And I fear I’m falling for the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>***&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m not out to make friends. My goals are simple - fight till the end for my clients, and my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The last thing I need is a vibrant, outgoing, snarky, and surprisingly big-hearted wedding planner to spend my precious free time with...except, watching Piper bond with my daughter just might break down the cinder block walls I’ve built around my heart these last few years.&nbsp;</p> <p>Second chances don’t come around for guys like me...or do they?</p>";
