window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Emma is super pretty, super smart, and super rich. So WHY is she kidnapping the billionaire she just bought in the bachelor auction?</b></p> <p>Thirteen years before Emma Dumas bought me in a bachelor auction to teach me a lesson, she stole my heart down on Key West. I fell so hard for this girl, I made all the promises. Only with Emma, I really meant them.</p> <p>And then I disappeared.</p> <p>But it wasn’t my fault. Let’s just call my reason “Family Business”. I’d tell you what that business is, but then I’d have to kill you. Just kidding. I can’t tell you what my family business is because it’s so secret, even I don’t know.</p> <p>My point is...I didn’t ghost. It was a weird twist of circumstances. And OK, yes. I did hook up with pretty much every girl on the island that week. But after I met Emma, I was ruined. She’s the only one I wanted.</p> <p>It’s been 13 years. I’m a changed man. I STILL want her. I have ALWAYS wanted her.</p> <p>But it’s kind of hard to tell her that with a gag in my mouth and a hood over my head.</p> <p><b><i>Jesse</i></b><b> features a bachelor auction gone wrong, four smart ladies who botch a crazy revenge kidnapping, a fancy power dream date with fast cars, private jets, and expensive yachts, lots of ex-sex, and a happily ever after that proves...sometimes the best man for the job is a woman.</b></p> <p>Includes a special bonus note from the author.</p>";
