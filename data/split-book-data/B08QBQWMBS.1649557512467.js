window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new, sexy stand-alone from number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller Vi Keeland.</b></p> <p>The first time I met Hudson Rothschild was at a wedding. I’d received an unexpected invitation to one of the swankiest venues in the city.</p> <p>Hudson was a groomsman and quite possibly the most gorgeous man I’d ever laid eyes on. He asked me to dance, and our chemistry was off the charts.</p> <p>I knew it wasn’t a good idea to get involved with him, considering the wedding I was at. But our connection was intense, and I was having a great time.</p> <p>Though the fun came to a screeching halt when Hudson figured out I wasn’t who I’d said I was. You see, that unexpected invitation I received? Well, it hadn’t actually been addressed to me - it was sent to my ex-roommate who’d bounced a check for two months’ rent and moved out in the middle of the night. I figured she owed me an expensive night out, but I guess, technically, I was crashing the wedding.</p> <p>Once caught, I couldn’t get out of there fast enough. As I bolted for the door, I might’ve plucked a few bottles of expensive champagne off the tables I passed, all while the gorgeous, angry groomsman was hot on my tail.</p> <p>Outside, I jumped into a taxi. My heart ricocheted against my ribs as we drove down the block - but at least I’d escaped unscathed.</p> <p>Or so I thought.</p> <p>Until I realized I’d left my cell phone behind at the table.</p> <p>Take one guess who found it?</p> <p>This is the crazy story of how Hudson Rothschild and I met. But trust me, it’s only the tip of the iceberg.</p>";
