Humanity has a chance. </p> <p>In the near future, an alien probe arrives on Earth with a pivotal mission: to determine if humanity has what it takes to survive the impending invasion by a merciless armada. The probe discovers Marc Ibarra, a young inventor who holds the key to a daring gambit that could save a fraction of Earth's population.

One strong enough to fight a battle against annihilation. </p> <p><i>The Ember War</i> is the first installment in an epic military sci-fi series. If you enjoyed <i>A Hymn Before Battle</i> by John Ringo and <i>The Last Starship</i> by Vaughn Heppner, then you'll love this explosive adventure with constant thrills and high stakes from beginning to end. </p> <p><i>The Ruins of Anthalas</i>, book 2: An ancient holocaust holds the key to humanity's survival. </p> <p>Only a sliver of mankind survived the Xaros invasion.
