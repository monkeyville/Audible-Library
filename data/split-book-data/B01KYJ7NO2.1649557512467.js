But I just knew I needed something different to happen. I needed someone...something...to derail me from my current path. Otherwise I would become lost...a hollowed-out shell of a man. So I did it. I approached her, then I pursued her, then I made her mine. And my life was saved....\" </p> <p>Ryan Burnham is the privileged son of a US congressman and captain of his university's hockey team. While he is on the verge of fulfilling his dreams to play in the NHL, his parents want him on a different course.

She is struggling to make her own way, working two jobs, attending college part time, and volunteering in a homeless shelter. She is on a mission to build her own success. </p> <p>With a chance meeting, their vastly different worlds collide, causing each to evaluate whether they are truly on the correct path to self-fulfillment and happiness. Can their relationship survive? Particularly when others are against them every step of the way? A lot can happen in just 10 short days.... </p>";
