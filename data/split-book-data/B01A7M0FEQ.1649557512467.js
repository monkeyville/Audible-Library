window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From best-selling author Chantal Fernando, the second book in a sexy romance series featuring the bad boys of the Wind Dragons Motorcycle Club and the women who fall in love with them. </p> <p>Being the younger sister of a Wind Dragons MC member isn't as great as you'd think it would be. I can't escape the details of my brother's exploits. No one tells me anything. Men who know who I am tend to stay away from me. And worst of all: The members of the MC are off-limits. When Arrow catches my eye, I make it my mission to make him happy again. When I fall head over heels in love with him, I just hope he will be there to catch me. And that my brother doesn't kill him.... </p>";
