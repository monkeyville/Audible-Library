He takes me under his wing, helps me flat-hunt, and even coaches me through some dates.</p> <p>Until his coaching starts to feel a lot like actual dating and my crush is back with a vengeance.</p> <p>I know that loving Joshua leads to disaster but I can’t help but wonder whether the way he looks at me has changed and whether when we kiss, it feels as real to him as it does to me.</p>";
