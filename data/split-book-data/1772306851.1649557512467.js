window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Cilla </b></p> <p>The Beast had Belle. Killian Black has me.&nbsp;</p> <p>How I got here doesn’t matter, even though he says it does. Says it was my choice. He doesn’t get it, though. It wasn’t ever a choice for me.&nbsp;</p> <p>And now, he’s changing the rules.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement was one month. For 30 days, I’d be his. He’s no longer satisfied with my body alone, though. He wants my soul, too. Wants every part of me. And even though I can pretend I’m safe when I lie beneath him, this man does something to me. Something wicked.&nbsp;</p> <p>A thing that will break me.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Killian </b></p> <p>Cilla made the choice. She offered the deal. I just took her up on it. So what if I changed the rules halfway in? I’m not apologizing for it.&nbsp;</p> <p>See, Cilla and me, we’re the same. She’s dark. As dark as me. Something happened to her. Something bad. It damaged her.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it’s not a hero she seeks. It’s an avenging angel. A dark knight. That, I can do. I’ll slay her dragons, but it’ll cost her, because in return, I want everything. And I’ll take it.&nbsp;</p> <p>She’s mine.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Killian</i> is a stand-alone dark romance, originally published as <i>Captive Beauty.</i></p>";
