window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Amazon Top 25 Best Seller</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Five years ago, my fiancé disappeared. He left me with a wedding dress I’d never wear. Left me with the kind of scars that can’t be healed. The man I built my future on vanished like a ghost. All that remained were my broken heart and a million unanswered questions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until a mysterious stranger arrives in town.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tall, dark, and dangerous, Kage is as full of secrets as he is sex appeal. Though I know he’s hiding something, I’m drawn to him like a moth to flame. Heat crackles between us with every look, desire flares into passion, and I fall hard, helpless to resist.&nbsp;</p> <p>But then I discover he’s been sent to collect on an unpaid debt from my missing fiancé....</p> <p>And that debt is me.&nbsp;</p>";
