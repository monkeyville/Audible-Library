window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She wasn't supposed to be the princess I </b><b><i>wasn't</i></b><b> looking for.</b></p> <p>When my father \"died\" five years ago, I took over the \"family business\". But when I say business, I really mean secret society. Or cult. Or militia. Hell, let's keep it simple and call it the mob.</p> <p>It's just not <i>that</i> mob.</p> <p>It's much darker, much dirtier, and much more dangerous than any old everyday mob.</p> <p>And I was perfectly fine with my role in life for a long time. But now my brothers are involved, and I need to get them out.</p> <p>Enter Megan Machette.</p> <p>When I found her helpless, nearly naked, and chained to a wall on an island prison, I had no intention of being her Prince Charming. But then I found out she had a dirty, dark, dangerous secret that could solve all my family problems.</p> <p>I was just going to use her. Play her. Tell her everything she wanted to hear.</p> <p>I never planned on baring my secrets to her in a midnight confession, and I certainly never expected her to see past the dark filth inside my soul and find the man underneath.</p> <p>But she did.</p> <p>She wasn't supposed to be the princess I <i>wasn't</i> looking for.</p> <p>But she is.</p> <p>And now I will do anything - even use her evil secret to take down thousands of people - to save my brothers and get what I want.</p> <p>Her.</p> <p><i>Johnny</i> features a prince saving his princess from a life of hell, one or 10 romantic gestures from a tattooed bad boy, swimming with glowing dolphins in the Bahamas, and secrets so deep everyone almost drowns. This is Book Three in the series and can be listened to alone, but should be listened to in order.</p> <p>Includes a special bonus note from the author.</p>";
