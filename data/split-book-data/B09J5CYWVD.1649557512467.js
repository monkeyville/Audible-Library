window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A billionaire boss, a terror on the ice with ego to spare, and a hockey-playing prince are here to entertain you with their love stories in this box set introducing the Copper Valley Thrusters hockey team!</b></p> <p><i>Mister McHottie</i> is the hilariously sexy prequel to the Copper Valley Thrusters series, where you’ll first meet the twin tank hockey players who inspired the next books. It comes complete with an organic happy-ever-after (or seven), a Bratwurst Wagon, ill-advised office pranks between a billionaire boss and the woman he tormented as a child, and no cheating or cliffhangers.</p> <p><i>The Pilot and the Puck-Up</i> is a stand-alone romantic comedy featuring a hockey player whose ego is the only thing bigger than his shoe size, a fierce lady-boss pilot, rubber chockey (don't ask), and no cheating or cliffhangers.</p> <p><i>Royally Pucked</i> is a side-splittingly epic romance between a spare heir and the lady least likely to ever wear a princess crown, complete with dirty cookies, an emotional support monkey, and lots of pucking around. This romantic comedy stands alone with no cheating, cliffhangers, and ends happily with a family of…more than two.</p>";
