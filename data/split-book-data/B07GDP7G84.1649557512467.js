window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Internationally best-selling author Chantal Fernando brings fans another sexy motorcycle novella in the Wind Dragons MC series, as rival club president Talon has to decide what's more dangerous: facing down the WDMC, or losing his heart to a woman under their protection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Talon has a complicated relationship with the Wind Dragons Motorcycle Club. He’s the president of their rival club, the Wild Men, but he’s also related to one of their members - who hates him. He could handle that, but he’s also got problems in his own club; someone is leaking information and disrupting their business, but Talon can’t find the mole. So the last thing he needs is even more complication in the form of a beautiful single mother who’s bolder than half the bikers on his squad. But he can't take his eyes - or his hands - off her....</p> <p>Tia’s always been a little reckless, up for a good time wherever she found it, but she’s also a great mom to her young son. So even though she thinks Talon is basically sex on a stick, when she realizes she wants to be more to him than just a club groupie, she has to take things a bit slow. Plus, a momentary attraction, no matter how smoking hot, isn’t worth risking her son’s happiness in any way. Is there any chance that Talon might be up for a more permanent arrangement? Or has Tia leapt before looking once again?</p>";
