window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meet the Damage Control boys - set in the world of the best-selling series Inked Brotherhood. </p> <p>There's me: Micah Owens. Tattoo artist at Damage Control. No parents or siblings. A past that still gives me nightmares. </p> <p>And then there's her: Evangeline, the girl who saved my life and haunts my more pleasant dreams. Only she doesn't know who I really am, and telling her might well send her fleeing for the hills. She deserves better than a loser like me. She's pretty. She's clever. She's goddamn sexy and has a heart of gold. </p> <p>Which is why I can't tell her. A smile from her and I'll do all I can to make her mine - including pretending to be someone I'm not, someone worth having. </p> <p>Isn't love weird? </p> <p>Note: This is a stand-alone novel. No cliff-hanger. </p> <p>Warning: This audiobook contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature listeners only. Not intended for young listeners. </p>";
