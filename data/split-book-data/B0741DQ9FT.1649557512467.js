window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I lived in the dark for three years. My whole world revolved around the whims and happiness of three men. It was just a trip into the forbidden. A way out of a bad situation and forward into nothingness. </p> <p>Quin, with his easy smile and charming good looks. He was always there for me...until he wasn't. </p> <p>Smith and his dispassionate attention. He was never there for me and he never regretted it. </p> <p>Bric, the one who listened, but only to himself. Self-absorbed, self-obsessed, and self-serving. He was never the one I wanted. </p> <p>And now he might be the only one I have left. </p> <p>It was good while it lasted, I guess. But it could've been so much more. It could've been so much better. </p> <p>And that's why I'm turning back. </p> <p>Includes a special bonus note read by the author. </p>";
