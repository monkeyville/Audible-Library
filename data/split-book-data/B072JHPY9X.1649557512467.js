Now that he's standing in front of her - body hard and chiseled from a stint in the military, suit cut to perfection, and a smirk she could never resist - remembering all the reasons why just got a whole lot harder. </p> <p>Ford gets Ellie isn't his biggest fan. He just doesn't care. </p> <p>Standing in front of him, giving him hell, she's even prettier than he remembered. All he can think about is how she felt in his arms, the taste of her kiss, the sound of her giggle in the middle of the night. He may not know how to win her back, but he does know this: he may have let her go once, but that's one mistake he won't make again. </p> <p><i>Swear</i> is a heartfelt and steamy standalone romance. </p>";
