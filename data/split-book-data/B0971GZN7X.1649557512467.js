Shen comes a brand-new romantic mafia stand-alone about the thin line between love and obsession.</i></p> <p><b>“Maybe we were never meant for each other. But that night at the carnival, when you showed me who you were, I figured out who I wanted to be.”</b></p> <p>The most important thing I’d ever read was scribbled on the door of a portable restroom, engraved into plastic at a carnival on the outskirts of Boston.</p> <p>Lust lingers, love stays.</p> <p>Lust is impatient, love waits.</p> <p>Lust burns, love warms.</p> <p>Lust destroys, but love? Love kills.</p> <p>Maybe it was always my destiny to fall in love with a monster.</p> <p>When other kids stayed awake at night fearing the pointy-toothed beast hiding in their closet, I longed to see mine.</p> <p>I wanted to feed it, domesticate it, understand it.</p> <p>Sam and I were only allowed to love each other in the dark.</p> <p>Once our story unfolded, and the truth came to light, I was the one to cut the cord.</p> <p>My name is Aisling Fitzpatrick, and I have a confession to make.</p> <p>Sam Brennan is not the only monster in this story.</p>";
