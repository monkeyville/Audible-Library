window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Heavy lies the crown....</b></p> <p>I thought getting my revenge would give me some kind of peace. Instead, it seems to have brought an even worse villain to my doorstep.</p> <p>Or rather, to the Nobles’ doorstep, which the big boss of Paradise Bend’s most powerful gang is not at all happy about. I may have won over Wylder Noble and his men, but his father is another story entirely.&nbsp;</p> <p>A brutally murderous story.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stuck between a vicious gang king and a psychotic stalker set on total domination, I’m not sure yet whether I’m going to win this war or go down fighting. If I fall, will these men who’ve set my body on fire - and somehow worked their way into my heart - fall with me?</p> <p>Not if Mercy Katz has anything to say about it.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m the heir to <i>my</i> father’s throne, and I’m going to wear the hell out of that crown as long as I’m still breathing.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Ruthless Queen</i> is the third book in a new gritty contemporary romance series from best-selling author Eva Chase (writing as Eva Chance) and Harlow King. No major triggers, but be prepared for domineering men who make their own rules, a rebellious heroine who's not afraid to get her hands dirty, and an enemies-to-lovers romance where the girl gets <i>all</i> the guys. It's going to be a wild, bloody ride!</p>";
