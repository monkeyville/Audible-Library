window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winning games has always been his focus, but will winning her heart become the ultimate goal?</b></p> <p>Everyone at Moo U knows the party doesn’t start until Paige Underwood arrives. Not only is she beautiful, she’s fun and charming too. Guys want to date her, and girls want to be her best friend. All Paige wants is to have a good time and make videos for her beauty channel - and maybe get that girl down the hall to do her eyeliner correctly. Is that too much to ask?</p> <p>According to her parents, yes. They’ve said the party’s over and that it’s time to get focused.</p> <p>Spencer Briggs knows all about focus. He’s had one goal since he set foot on the ice as a kid: Make it to the NHL. After years of hard work and endless practice, he’s the starting goalie for Moo U and mere steps away from his dream. He can’t afford distractions, and isn’t interested in relationships. And he definitely can’t afford to flirt back with the gorgeous girl in his lit class.&nbsp;</p> <p>He needs to stay serious. She needs to get serious. But now, serious sparks are flying....</p>";
