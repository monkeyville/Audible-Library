window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Indulge in three best-selling standalone romances narrated by Sebastian York and Andi Arndt in this collection of the Heartbreakers Series from number one <i>New York Times</i> best seller Lauren Blakely!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Once Upon a Real Good Time</i></p> <p>That smoking hot one-night stand with a former rock star? Turns out he’s my son’s new music teacher.</p> <p>The night I met Campbell all I knew was he played my body the same way he strummed a guitar — like he owned it. Now I’ve learned he’s the man coming to my house twice a week to teach my kid — the best music lessons money can buy.</p> <p>Time to turn down the volume on the late-night shenanigans with the sexy single dad. Only that’s easier said than done....</p> <p>***</p> <p><i>Once Upon a Sure Thing</i></p> <p>Mix one charming rock star, his sweet and sassy best friend, and a lust that’s been brewing for years....</p> <p>My friendship with Miller is a sure thing. He’s my plus one, my emergency contact, and my shoulder to lean on. He’s also been by my side helping me raise an awesome kid who’s the center of my world.</p> <p>Nothing will change our easy breezy friendship. Until I have the bright idea to convince him to start a new band with me....</p> <p>***</p> <p><i>Once Upon a Wild Fling </i></p> <p>My brother’s best friend has a proposition for me. Have I mentioned he’s a sexy single dad? Tell me more....</p> <p>There are a million reasons why Miles Hart isn’t the man I should date but allow me to list the top three. He’s friends with my brother, he’s a single dad, and he’s a gorgeous, in-demand rock star. He might as well wear an off-limits, totally unavailable, and don’t-even-attempt-to-ride-this-ride sign.</p> <p>Then he asks me to be his plus-one when his band plays at his high school reunion, and the night unfolds in ways I never expect....</p>";
