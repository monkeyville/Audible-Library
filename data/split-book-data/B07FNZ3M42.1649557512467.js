We met the stars of Chantal Fernando’s best-selling series in <i>Dragon’s Lair</i>, and now Sin and Faye are ready for more - and with these two, that means more passion, more action, and more of the best kind of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sin, president of the Wind Dragons Motorcycle Club, doesn’t mind that things have quieted down since he got married - with Faye at his side, he’ll never be bored. Plus, they’ve got their little girl Clover to keep them on their toes. But when new MC brother Talon needs help rooting out a traitor in his old club, Faye’s the first to volunteer. She’s more determined than ever to get involved and put her law degree to good use, but Sin soon finds himself riding to the rescue. Because he’ll kill anybody who touches a hair on Faye’s head - if she doesn’t get to them first. One way or another, tonight’s going to be <i>someone’s </i>last ride....</p>";
