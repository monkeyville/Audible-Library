window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The dreamiest player on the Moo U hockey team hangs a flyer on the bulletin board, and I am spellbound:</p> <p><i>Rent a boyfriend for the holiday. For $25, I will be your Thanksgiving date. I will talk hockey with your dad. I will bring your mother flowers. I will be polite, and wear a nicely ironed shirt....</i></p> <p>Now everyone knows it’s a bad idea to introduce your long-time crush to your messed-up family. But I really do need a date for Thanksgiving, even if I’m not willing to say why. So I tear his phone number off of that flyer...and accidentally entangle our star defenseman in a ruse that neither of us can easily unwind.</p> <p>Because Weston's family is even nuttier than mine. He needs a date, too, for the most uncomfortable holiday engagement party ever thrown.&nbsp;</p> <p>There will be hors d'oeuvre. There will be faked PDA. And there will be pro-level awkwardness…</p> <p><i>Boyfriend is a full-length book for Weston and Abbi!&nbsp;</i></p>";
