Just come a little closer. </p> <p>\"Someone who will stand tall in the face of adversity,\" she says. </p> <p>I'll do it standing, sitting, or lying down. See how easy I am? </p> <p>\"Someone who believes in the value of a good deed,\" she says. </p> <p>I believe in the value of me, sweetheart. Because I'm Lincoln Wade. Jaded genius, obscenely wealthy, capable of violence, and looking for revenge. </p> <p>Molly Masters might have delusions of grandeur. She might see me as some superman capable of cleaning up the scum, filth, and corruption in Cathedral City. </p> <p>But I'm not the hero she's looking for. </p> <p>I'm the dark alley where all her good intentions hide. </p> <p>So be careful what you wish for, Molly Masters. </p> <p>Because you're about to get it. </p>";
