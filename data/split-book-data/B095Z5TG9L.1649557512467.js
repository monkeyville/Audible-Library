Just this once ... please, Walker.\"</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Those whispered words were my undoing....</p> <p>As the most hated player in baseball, I had two options: either clean up my image, or pack my bags. Being traded wasn't an option which only meant one thing, I had to become compliant.&nbsp;</p> <p>That's how I found myself sharing a small bistro table with Kate Chapman, the Chicago Bobbies newest PR Manager. Devastatingly beautiful, vastly intelligent, and incredibly cunning, she knows exactly how to handle my grumpy demeanor.</p> <p>It was supposed to be simple. Book some PR events, show up, smile for the camera, and be done. But one massive mistake on my end sends me into the trenches with Kate, forcing me to open up to her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Innocent glances turn into cordial encounters.</p> <p>Secret touches turn into tempting invitations.</p> <p>And dangerous nights alone turn into consuming desperation.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ve never wanted a woman as much as I want her. And I know she wants me, but there’s a no fraternizing with the players rule. Neither of us can afford to lose our jobs, but we also can't seem to keep our hands off each other, either.</p>";
