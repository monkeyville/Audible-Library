window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An all-new, sizzling stand-alone romance from&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling Author Kendall Ryan....</b></p> <p><i>Holt</i></p> <p>Six years ago, Eden barged into my life and turned everything upside down.</p> <p>We spent one scorching-hot night together, and then she disappeared into the sunset with the golden jock everyone adored. Which makes sense, right? A girl as beautiful and brilliant as Eden Wynn doesn’t end up with a rebel like me.</p> <p>I expected them to live happily ever after, but that's not what happened. She's back in my life - and tempting me like no one else has. And while I'm certain I'll only tarnish her shine, I want her.</p> <p>I'd heard the old notion that one night held the power to change everything. I just never believed it.</p> <p>Until now.</p> <p><i>Eden</i></p> <p>I’m public enemy number one.</p> <p>Turns out, the East Coast is protective of their hockey team and very vocal about not wanting a young female owner. Well, too bad, because this team is all Grandpa Wynn left me, and I have no intention of walking away.</p> <p>Enter my new head of security, Holt Rossi. My history with him is...<i>complicated.</i> Chemistry reignites between us while the world waits for me to stumble.</p> <p>He’s supposed to protect me - but who will protect my heart from him?</p> <p><b>Warning: This romance contains one growly, broken hero; a bunch of rowdy hockey players; and a smart, hardworking heroine whose life hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows. This is a no-cheating, scorching-hot love story with a guaranteed HEA.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
