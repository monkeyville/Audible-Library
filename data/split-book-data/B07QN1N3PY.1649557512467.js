He’s effortlessly talented and intelligent - spending his summers playing drums in the local band and the rest of the year teaching high school in the same Jersey town where he grew up. He likes his love life simple too, enjoying the commitment-free hook-ups his good looks and sexy charm have always made oh so easy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then he meets Lainey Burrows. And his simple, easy life gets turned upside down.&nbsp;</p> <p>One wild one-night stand was all it was ever supposed to be, so Lainey is shocked when she discovers that her sizzling summer fling is also her son’s new math teacher. But that’s nothing compared to the most unexpected twist of all - their hot hook-up left Lainey knocked up, and now they’re about to become parents. Together.&nbsp;</p> <p>What ensues is an addictive, insatiable, sweet and tender romance that won’t be simple, but it will be more than worth the fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
