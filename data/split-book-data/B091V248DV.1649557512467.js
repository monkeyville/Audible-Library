window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a top draft pick from a family of hockey royalty, I'm under so much pressure that I’m losing my edge on the ice. I need something to snap my brain out of this self-destructive stress-loop. That’s where Indi Briscoe from my photography class comes in. She’s flirtatious and funny one moment, sweetly shy the next.&nbsp;</p> <p>But she’s cagey. She has secrets. Also? She’s a virgin. Did I mention the pressure thing? Maybe I’m crazy for starting something with her. But we can’t seem to help ourselves....&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: This stand-alone novel contains heat, heart, familial expectations, extreme milkshakes, and a hamster with deep thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
