window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With the paparazzi hot on her heels, Mandy Bettencourt is desperate for somewhere to hide, and her best friend has just the place.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s perfect. No Internet. No phone. A deep bathtub she’s busy soaking in when <i>he</i> shows up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her best friend’s brother, Dante Crowne. Rich as a cardinal sin and handsome enough to piss off the devil. A man with a brooding, no-nonsense attitude and a reputation for unforgettable bedroom games.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mandy got an early taste of them in high school - for seven minutes in a closet. She can tell you, the rumors are all true.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dante knows he’s got a reputation for a lot of things, including a love of solitude.&nbsp;</p> <p>But there’s a beautiful socialite in his bathtub, and the memory of those seven minutes isn’t inspiring him to kick her out.&nbsp;</p> <p>So he offers her a deal.&nbsp;</p> <p>If she wants to stay, she has to work.&nbsp;</p> <p>If she makes a mistake, she’s corrected with pink hand marks on her backside.&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s the deal.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beg for it or leave it.&nbsp;</p> <p>He’s surprised when she agrees, and he’s even more surprised when she likes the punishment.&nbsp;</p> <p>The most shocking thing, though, is how much he’s starting to like <i>her.</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>They can’t stay in paradise forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>Los Angeles awaits.&nbsp;</p> <p>But an old nemesis sets his sights on tearing them apart, and Dante may be the one left begging.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Crowne Rules is a complete standalone. You don’t have to listen to any of the Crowne Brothers books to pick this up, but you might want to once you’re done with Dante.</i></p>";
