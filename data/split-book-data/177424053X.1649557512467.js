But that’s not what I’ll be sticking in there.</i></p> <p><b>Lyssa</b></p> <p>Freelance princess hunter Mason Macintyre thinks he’s so tough with those bulging muscles. He thinks he’s so smart with his plan to tame me with spankings and submission. Well, I’ve got news for him. They don’t call me Wild Thing for nothing.</p> <p>I’ve been playing unruly princess my whole life, and I’m not about to stop now.</p> <p><b>Mason</b></p> <p>This was supposed to be a simple kidnap job. Catch her and bring her in so she can be married off to the son of a family friend. But once her father realizes the man he hired to reform his unruly brat of a daughter won’t be able to handle her, he blackmails me into completing the job.</p> <p>No one blackmails me, I don’t care how rich and powerful you are. Her father might be untouchable, but Lyssa isn’t. I’m gonna touch her all over and punish her so hard that forced marriage will be her only way out of my little princess reform school.</p> <p><i>Wild Thing</i> is a smokin'-hot, sexy story of a runaway princess and her reluctant Prince Charming. A tantalizing tale of forced marriage, captive submission, and a hero who doesn’t know he’s a hero until he meets the girl he was meant to save.</p> <p><i>Includes a special note from the author.</i></p>";
