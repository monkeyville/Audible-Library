window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Are you stalking me?”</b></p> <p><b>\"We live right next door to each other, New Girl.”</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Bay Bishop aka The New Girl is my new neighbor. Glasses, stage crew black clothes, and a knack for fading into the background.&nbsp;</p> <p>She’s probably the only one who rolls her eyes when I walk past instead of cheering on my last touchdown play. But before I can shove her into the recesses of my mind filed under “Not my problem”, she lands herself smack dab in the middle of my dreams.</p> <p>I catch her singing with a voice unlike any I’ve heard before that taps into feelings I shouldn’t have for the girl who avoids me at all costs. I need to know why she hates me.</p> <p>With three months until graduation, the final play is on. Only it’s not for more points. It’s for Bay.</p> <p>Unlike my success on the field, this win is anything but assured. But I can’t stop myself from taking the risk.&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s no flashing scoreboard.</p> <p>There’s no cheering crowd.</p> <p>There’s only her and me.</p> <p>The countdown clock is ticking. The only thing scarier about finding my first love will be losing her.</p> <p><i>The Art of Falling for You</i> is the first book in the new Fulton U universe sports romance, Falling trilogy.</p>";
