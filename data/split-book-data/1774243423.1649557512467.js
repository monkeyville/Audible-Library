window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Even at 37, with a challenging but rewarding career as a paramedic, Bella Gomez is treated as the baby of the family. It's made her allergic to anyone meddling, so she chooses to keep mostly to herself. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop her family from inserting themselves in her life. Nor does it deter the one man she knows she shouldn't get close to from showing up on her doorstep.</p> <p>Jasper Greene, an FBI agent with the La Plata County field office, doesn't even know the meaning of family. His team is his family, which is why - when his boss asks him to keep an eye on his baby sister - Jasper readily complies. Even when the sister in question is a spectacularly developed princess with plenty of attitude.</p> <p>With a shooter on the loose and corruption running rampant, Bella is a magnet for trouble, and Jasper finds himself with his hands full - in more ways than one.</p>";
