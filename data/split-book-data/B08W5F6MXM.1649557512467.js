window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>NYT</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>best-selling author A.L. Jackson comes a friends-to-lovers romance about an unattainable rock star and his best friend’s younger sister....</b></p> <p>Maggie Fitzgerald is the last girl I should think about taking to my bed.</p> <p>On the cusp of turning 21, she has her whole life waiting out ahead of her - sexy AF, while still radiating an innocence that I know better than to taint.&nbsp;And here I am, itching to reach out and touch a girl who is so forbidden that just thinking about her feels like committing a mortal sin. Thing is I love playing with fire.</p> <p>Rhys Manning is everything I shouldn’t want. Country-rock’s newest superstar. Fun. Wild. Ready to show the world a good time. He’s so off-limits - it isn’t even funny. So out of reach he might as well be a poster tacked on my wall. Too bad every time he looks at me, my heart races out of control. Now, I’m stuck living with him for the entire summer.</p> <p>We’re only supposed to be friends. Still, I should have known it was a terrible idea when I started sneaking into his room. Especially when it’s clear he’s keeping secrets.&nbsp;Secrets that might destroy us both.&nbsp;</p> <p>One touch, and I want more.&nbsp;</p> <p>One kiss, and I’m spiraling out of control.</p> <p>I know it’s reckless to start dancing in the flames. But in exchange for getting to spend one night with this brooding bad boy? I might be willing to get burned....</p>";
