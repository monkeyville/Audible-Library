First kiss. <i>The one I left behind.</i></p> <p>Only - he isn't the same boy I gave my heart to.</p> <p>This new Jace is as cruel as he is gorgeous. And he's determined to make my life a living hell. Along with the rest of his glorified family and crew of tyrants.</p> <p>They expect me to worship the ground they walk on like everyone else, but I'd rather eat dirt.</p> <p>If Jace Covington wants me gone...he'll have to try harder. Because I've never been the kind of girl to play by the rules.</p> <p>Warning: Royal Hearts Academy is a new adult/high school series of standalones filled with drama, a touch of angst, and boys who are bad to the bone.
