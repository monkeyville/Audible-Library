window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’m banished to Vermont for a scandal that wasn’t my fault, and broke because my famous father cut me off. And did I mention my roommate stole my boyfriend? Yeah, I’m loving my Moo U experience.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now I need a job, because this gel manicure won’t upkeep itself. The only available option is the last one I’d ever want - a job as the hockey team’s equipment manager. My plan is to do the bare minimum, get paid, and find my way back into my father’s good graces.&nbsp;</p> <p>I will not get involved with a hockey player, no matter how hot. They’re cocky. And obnoxious. I know their type, and I’m not willing to risk getting hurt again. Until Lex Vonne glides into my life looking like sin on a stick.&nbsp;</p> <p>He thinks I’m a spoiled brat.&nbsp;</p> <p>I think he’s using me to get ahead.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the fire I feel when we’re together is like a slapshot to my heart....</p>";
