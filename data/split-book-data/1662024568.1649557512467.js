window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I got the dreaded phone call, the one every baseball player hopes and prays never comes. I was traded - yeah, that phone call - traded from my longtime team of over 10 years to not just any team...to my childhood rivals, the Chicago Rebels.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was completely and utterly screwed, right? Wrong. The trade was the least of my concerns. I met a girl, Natalie. She was perfect, but I swore I would never get involved with anyone during the season. It was too complicated. But can you believe I had zero restraint when it came to this girl? I couldn't get her out of my head, and the more I talked to her the more I realized I needed her in my life.&nbsp;</p> <p>So what's the problem? Why am I screwed? Because, Natalie, the girl I can't stop crushing on, yeah...she's married.... At least, that's what I was told....</p>";
