window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He's her patient. She's his doctor. They shouldn't. But God, do they want to. </p> <p>Camden Harris, the famously hot, hulk of a footballer is laid up in a London hospital. But his busted knee doesn't stop him from running his well-practiced game on Indie Porter - his redheaded spitfire of a doctor. She's not his type, not even close. But she could be the perfect distraction from the soul-crushing damage this injury could cost him. </p> <p>Indie's tired of her naivety putting a target on her back. As a gifted child, she's let her education take the front seat her whole life. But a fling with a footballer like Camden might be just what she needs to grab life by the balls. </p> <p>And he could be the perfect guy for the plan she's been sitting on for over two years. </p> <p>But when feelings make a final play, there's no amount of medicine that can heal the damage to their hearts. </p>";
