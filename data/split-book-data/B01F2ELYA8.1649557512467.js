window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bryce Matthews doesn't do the whole nice boyfriend thing. Chocolates and flowers - girls can forget all that. And he certainly doesn't care about the gossip and rumors that follow him at school and around town. If anything, the talk amuses him. </p> <p>Bryce isn't lacking in confidence. He knows himself, and he knows his limits. One of those hard limits is Madison Issac. Bryce can never have her, and he's perfectly fine with that. Sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality anyway. </p> <p>Madison Issac thought she was a pretty good judge of character. But she's surprised at how gentle and comforting resident bad-boy and next-door neighbor Bryce Matthews is when he finds her crying in the park. </p> <p>Maybe there's more to Bryce than people think? Madison begins to wonder. Can a guy like Bryce ever change his ways? Can a girl like Madison really be into a guy like Bryce? With hearts and reputations on the line, this kind of love can be scandalous. </p>";
