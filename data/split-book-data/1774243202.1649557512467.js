Her failure of a marriage firmly in her rearview mirror and her recent business expansion a success, she is in charge of her own future. One that is looking better than ever.&nbsp;</p> <p>The sight of the tall man, with the familiar salt-and-pepper goatee pushing open the door of her store, sets her hair on end. He doesn't exactly bring good memories.&nbsp;</p> <p>FBI Special Agent in Charge Damian Gomez is just looking for a decent cup of coffee when he walks into the small store offering books and brew. The pretty, feisty woman behind the counter is an unexpected surprise. Not at all unpleasant, especially since her finger that used to hold a wedding ring is now bare.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her wild hair, boho style, and silvery grey eyes suddenly hold a lot of promise.</p> <p>But when his office is pulled into an international investigation into the trafficking of rare books and manuscripts, the straight-laced SAC realizes he has to keep his distance from the woman who might well be involved.</p> <p>Easier said than done, since fate seems determined to throw them together.</p>";
